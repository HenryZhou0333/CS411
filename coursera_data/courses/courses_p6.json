            "description": "We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!",

By the end of the course, you will be able to apply the knowledge gained for analysis and management of international cyber incidents and conflicts including for activities such as development of policy related to cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Management of cyber incidents and conflicts requires an interdisciplinary perspective including an understanding of: 1) characteristics of the cyber threats and conflicts themselves, 2) international efforts to reduce and improve cyber security, and 3) psychological and sociopolitical factors. \n\nThe course is designed to reach an international audience and will encourage discussion on relevant current events among participants to enrich the experience with various personal and cultural perspectives on cutting-edge issues. In addition, assignments and other assessments will supplement video lectures and selected readings to ensure application of the material.\n\n\nAfter taking this course you will be able to:\n\n\u2022 Identify different types of actors involved in cyber threats (individuals, organizations & nation-states)\n\u2022 Distinguish between different types of threats and issues in cyber security including, data theft, political espionage, critical infrastructure protection, and propaganda\n\u2022 Detail the basic characteristics of the Internet infrastructure and international efforts to address Internet governance\n\u2022 List several international efforts to address cyber crime and espionage\n\u2022 Evaluate how principals that govern international conflicts might be applied in context of cyber security\n\u2022 Apply different psychological theories of human motivation and cooperation and communication and political theories in analysis of different international issues related to cyber security including censorship, media operations and role of social technologies.\n\n\nGrading:\n\nYour grade is assessed based on discussion posts and quizzes. Individual taking this course for credit (i.e. students at the University at Albany y will be required to engage in additional activities communicated to them directly). \n\n\nRecommended Background:\n\nNo background knowledge or skills are necessary, but an understanding and familiarity of cyber security, Internet infrastructure and international law would be advantageous for anyone who participates in the course.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nErsin Dincelli and Nic DePaula were the instructional designers for the course who assisted in the recording of the videos, reviewing material, creating slides, assessments and some of the content. Without their tremendous effort this would not have been possible. We also acknowledge the financial support for the recordings from the University at Albany as well as the support from Media and Marketing.

Who are the \u201cinfluential\u201d members of the network?  What are the sub-communities in the network?   Who is connected to whom, and by how many links?   These are just some of the questions you can explore in this project.\n\nWe will provide you with a real-world data set and some infrastructure for getting started, as well as some warm up tasks and basic project requirements, but then it\u2019ll be up to you where you want to take the project.  If you\u2019re running short on ideas, we\u2019ll have several suggested directions that can help get your creativity and imagination going.  Finally, to integrate the skills you acquired in course 4 (and to show off your project!) you will be asked to create a video showcase of your final product.",

English subtitles are planned but not yet available.\n\nFuels are the foundations of modern living. For over a century we have been drawing fossil fuels \u2013 oil, coal and natural gas \u2013 from the depths of the earth, and using them to power our world: advanced industries, fast transportation, comfortable homes and more. In this course we will examine possible alternatives for these fuels - which have proved quite damaging to both our health and our environment. We will describe the intensive worldwide efforts in this field of research, and present their encouraging outcome: a range of innovative technologies for generating clean energy from natural, non-polluting and renewable sources \u2013 such as sunlight, wind and water.\n\nThe course will open with some fundamental questions on energy: What are the energy needs of the global population today, and what will they be tomorrow? What are the resources at our disposal? What are the known processes for harvesting, converting and utilizing resources of energy? What are the problems generated by the use of fossil fuels? In what ways must we change our energy policies and energy economy? And most important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil fuels, and can they supply humanity's extensive and constantly growing energy needs?\n\nSubsequent lessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable energy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and bioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these resources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing conversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through the various methods, and assessing their economic feasibility.\n\nIn parallel, we will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must be done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy \u2013 in industry, in transportation, and in every other sphere of our lives. We will examine several advanced renewable energy technologies; explain why they have not yet taken the place of fossil fuels; and present cutting-edge innovations and promising research directions \u2013 in the ongoing global effort to ensure a sustainable future for us all.",

No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the corporate challenge, the CEO will introduce it as:\n\u201cIn this capstone, you will have to analyze a situation our company is experiencing today and prepare recommendations to our executive committee explaining how to implement the best possible solution to our leadership challenge.\u201d  \n\nThe challenge to be addressed will touch upon the capacity for an organization to grow while keeping its sense of purpose. WIth Poil\u00e2ne, the original sense of the company is anchored in the values of making the same quality bread for all. When increasing in size and outreach, how can Apollonia and her team maintain the same strong values across places and people? With Bla Bla Car, the fast pace growth of the company raises the same questions around identity. You will find more details as the Capstone unfolds.\nYou can also choose to work on your own organization challenge.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon\u2026) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhether you choose the corporate challenge or corporate challenge, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by the company or by yourself, the capacity for the stakeholders to address the issues. You will make recommendations as if you were at the head of the company or the problem.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 \u201cGiving Sense to your Leadership Experience\u201d and MOOC3 \u201cLeading Organizations\u201d with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the company or personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred scenario that respects the values and principles of the organization after the change.\nYou will prepare a 10\u2019 presentation for your recommendations to be delivered to the CEO of the company or owner of the challenge.",

While this course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that, in other parts of the world, the nature of the factors that influence the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors may vary. Nevertheless,it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser:https://goo.gl/IWDsEM\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 3 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: This week's questions: What factors influence the effectiveness of board meetings? What are the formal procedures and structures within the board that impact its performance? What can a board do to intentionally improve the way it structures itself and runs its decision making meetings? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions:  What do we mean by board composition and development and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of the board? How do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate, recruit and develop board members?   \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What do we mean by the \"culture\" of the board and why is it important? How do boards develop and pass along culture? Can board cultures be intentionally changed? What is the role of leadership in shaping board culture? What do effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do?  How can leadership be managed for higher performance?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach.\n\nIn this fifth part--part five of five--we cover a calculus for sequences, numerical methods, series and convergence tests, power and Taylor series, and conclude the course with a final exam.  Learners in this course can earn a certificate in the series by signing up for Coursera's verified certificate program and passing the series' final exam.",

The group could not only be an organization such as a company or a team in a company, but also a private group such as your family or an association. \n\nSpecifically, you\u2019ll apply the 4 steps of The Savoir-Relier protocol to your group: \n1. defining the group identity by working on the group self-awareness, \n2. creating quality relationships within the group, \n3. working on resilience for the group to then be able to overcome difficult situation and \n4. Making the organization grow by creating sense and meaning.\n\nSo if you want your group to grow as a successful leader in its fields, if you want to find your identity as a group and create shared values for it, or if you want your group to become more resilient in face of change and crisis, this course is made for you! Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts. You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.",

Vision Strategy and Action for Co. X\n2. Cross Country Analysis of Co. X when expanding into target new country.\n3. Market or Sector-Specific (B2B Marketing, Healthcare, Hospitality, Entertainment, Sports) Analysis for Co. X\n4. Cross Industry Innovation (new product development) of Co. X when sourcing ideas or expanding into another industry.\n\nAll of these analyses will have templates that will be explained in the video lectures. Each learner will be required to choose a company on which these analyses will be performed. As such, the intent will be to provide an integrated set of insights and application to a chosen managerial situation and problems at hand in the context of a specific region or country. Each learner will be required to also choose another industry (from the ones covered in the Specialization) when performing their Cross Industry Innovation. For example, a learner who has conducted an analysis for a company in the Healthcare industry can conduct a Cross Industry Innovation project using concepts from the Entertainment industry.",

We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or \u201cfootball,\u201d as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing.

In this course, you\u2019ll travel with Jim as he takes on leadership challenges ranging from strategy execution, to inspiring people, to maintaining an ethical approach. Experts agree that twentieth-century leadership practices are inadequate for the stormy twenty-first-century present. This provocative course equips you with the insights you'll need to rise with the occasion of a rapidly shifting business landscape.\n\nThe course is based on a book, Harder Than I Thought: Adventures of a 21st Century Leader, by Robert D.

Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural progression, the online course has been separated into 3 units, this is Unit 1.",

Game theory provides a general framework to describe and analyze how individuals behave in such \u201cstrategic\u201d situations.\n\nThis course focuses on the key concepts in game theory, and attempts to outline the informal basic ideas that are often hidden behind mathematical definitions. Game theory has been applied to a number of disciplines, including economics, political science, psychology, sociology, biology, and computer science. Therefore, a warm welcome is extended to audiences from all fields who are interested in what game theory is all about.",

In order to complete this assignment, you will need to make use of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon has generously offered to provide up to $50 in free AWS credit to each learner in this course to allow you to complete the assignment. Further details regarding the process of receiving this credit are available in the welcome message for the course, as well as in the assignment itself. Please note that Amazon, University of Washington, and Coursera cannot reimburse you for any charges if you exhaust your credit.\n\nWhile we believe that this assignment contributes an excellent learning experience in this course, we understand that some learners may be unable or unwilling to use AWS. We are unable to issue Course Certificates for learners who do not complete the assignment that requires use of AWS. As such, you should not pay for a Course Certificate in Communicating Data Results if you are unable or unwilling to use AWS, as you will not be able to successfully complete the course without doing so.\n\nMaking predictions is not enough!  Effective data scientists know how to explain and interpret their results, and communicate findings accurately to stakeholders to inform business decisions.  Visualization is the field of research in computer science that studies effective communication of quantitative results by linking perception, cognition, and algorithms to exploit the enormous bandwidth of the human visual cortex.  In this course you will learn to recognize, design, and use effective visualizations.\n\nJust because you can make a prediction and convince others to act on it doesn\u2019t mean you should.  In this course you will explore the ethical considerations around big data and how these considerations are beginning to influence policy and practice.   You will learn the foundational limitations of using technology to protect privacy and the codes of conduct emerging to guide the behavior of data scientists.  You will also learn the importance of reproducibility in data science and how the commercial cloud can help support reproducible research even for experiments involving massive datasets, complex computational infrastructures, or both.\n\nLearning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Design and critique visualizations\n2. Explain the state-of-the-art in privacy, ethics, governance around big data and data science\n3. Use cloud computing to analyze large datasets in a reproducible way.",

Si bien te podr\u00e1 parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos b\u00e1sicos ver\u00e1s qu\u00e9 r\u00e1pido se avanza.\nJava, como todos los lenguajes de programaci\u00f3n bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con m\u00e1s trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de c\u00f3mo piensas la soluci\u00f3n al problema). \nPero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extra\u00f1o, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como t\u00fa quieres y obtengas una satisfacci\u00f3n enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.\nEn este curso aprender\u00e1s:\n1. El proceso de desarrollar y ejecutar un programa.\n2. Qu\u00e9 es la orientaci\u00f3n a objetos (OO).\n3. Qu\u00e9 es un \u201cobjeto\u201d en el contexto de programaci\u00f3n.\n4. Qu\u00e9 quiere decir que Java sea un lenguaje \u201corientado a objetos\".",
