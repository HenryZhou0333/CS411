We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free.

For over a century we have been drawing fossil fuels – oil, coal and natural gas – from the depths of the earth, and using them to power our world: advanced industries, fast transportation, comfortable homes and more. In this course we will examine possible alternatives for these fuels - which have proved quite damaging to both our health and our environment. We will describe the intensive worldwide efforts in this field of research, and present their encouraging outcome: a range of innovative technologies for generating clean energy from natural, non-polluting and renewable sources – such as sunlight, wind and water.\n\nThe course will open with some fundamental questions on energy: What are the energy needs of the global population today, and what will they be tomorrow? What are the resources at our disposal? What are the known processes for harvesting, converting and utilizing resources of energy? What are the problems generated by the use of fossil fuels? In what ways must we change our energy policies and energy economy? And most important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil fuels, and can they supply humanity's extensive and constantly growing energy needs?\n\nSubsequent lessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable energy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and bioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these resources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing conversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through the various methods, and assessing their economic feasibility.\n\nIn parallel, we will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must be done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy – in industry, in transportation, and in every other sphere of our lives. We will examine several advanced renewable energy technologies; explain why they have not yet taken the place of fossil fuels; and present cutting-edge innovations and promising research directions – in the ongoing global effort to ensure a sustainable future for us all.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","name":"מבוא לאנרגיה מתחדשת -  Introduction to Renewable Energy","startDate":1456425238620,"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/28/9dbde0aedd11e592f52d1e33da9f3c/introduction-to-renewable-energy.jpg","workload":"","primaryLanguages":["he"],"partnerIds":["110"],"instructorIds":["9009600"]},{"id":"eo6NBCQPEeW5Rwo0txKkgQ","partnerIds":["26","299","300"],"description":"This course is for teachers to learn why some children have so much difficulty with reading and writing, often called 'dyslexia', and to learn more about best practice in teaching literacy to all in light of recent scientific discoveries.\n\nParticipation in or completion of this online course will not confer academic credit for University of London programmes","instructorIds":["6458138","6887418"],"courseType":"v2.ondemand","workload":"4-6 hours/week","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/d64a20df3611e386f0a7e1113bbe70/iStock_000011854913_teacher--children.jpg","slug":"dyslexia-difficulties","primaryLanguages":["en"],"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"education"}],"startDate":1439913626343,"name":"Supporting children with difficulties in reading and writing"},{"id":"sNx-mzaXEeWa2g6sjqf03Q","name":"CAPSTONE: Your Leadership Challenge","startDate":1441052208140,"instructorIds":["11182902"],"partnerIds":["161"],"description":"Welcome to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization! \nIn the next 6 weeks you'll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \nTo better meet your own goals of taking this Specialization, we provide two options for the capstone project: \n1) Personal leadership challenge; \n2) Cooperate leadership challenges. \nYou'll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from your Capstone peers. No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the corporate challenge, the CEO will introduce it as:\n“In this capstone, you will have to analyze a situation our company is experiencing today and prepare recommendations to our executive committee explaining how to implement the best possible solution to our leadership challenge.”  \n\nThe challenge to be addressed will touch upon the capacity for an organization to grow while keeping its sense of purpose. WIth Poilâne, the original sense of the company is anchored in the values of making the same quality bread for all. When increasing in size and outreach, how can Apollonia and her team maintain the same strong values across places and people? With Bla Bla Car, the fast pace growth of the company raises the same questions around identity. You will find more details as the Capstone unfolds.\nYou can also choose to work on your own organization challenge.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhether you choose the corporate challenge or corporate challenge, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by the company or by yourself, the capacity for the stakeholders to address the issues. You will make recommendations as if you were at the head of the company or the problem.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the company or personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred scenario that respects the values and principles of the organization after the change.\nYou will prepare a 10’ presentation for your recommendations to be delivered to the CEO of the company or owner of the challenge.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/33c8f044c211e594e0993d66d95520/Vignette-CAPSTONE_student.jpg","slug":"leadership-challenge","workload":"","primaryLanguages":["en"],"courseType":"v2.capstone"},{"id":"v1-131","description":"In this course, you will learn the fundamental computer science principles that power today’s apps.

Nevertheless,it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser:https://goo.gl/IWDsEM\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 3 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: This week's questions: What factors influence the effectiveness of board meetings? What are the formal procedures and structures within the board that impact its performance? What can a board do to intentionally improve the way it structures itself and runs its decision making meetings? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions:  What do we mean by board composition and development and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of the board? How do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate, recruit and develop board members?   \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What do we mean by the \"culture\" of the board and why is it important? How do boards develop and pass along culture? Can board cultures be intentionally changed? What is the role of leadership in shaping board culture? What do effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do?  How can leadership be managed for higher performance?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","instructorIds":["4751847","10476839"],"startDate":1451886398768,"partnerIds":["117"],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"slug":"nonprofit-gov-3","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4f/8ee8b07b3f11e5a1d34132b6f17db0/banner-image-without-tex-1t.jpg"},{"id":"v1-1822","workload":"3-4 hours/week","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"computer-security-and-networks"}],"primaryLanguages":["zh"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/4f/fcacb0352c11e4b1518bb3518fcc93/__.png","description":"从操作系统与虚拟化平台面临的安全问题和应该采取的安全机制入手，帮助你学习和掌握计算机系统安全的基本理论、技术、方法和评测标准。Learn about operating system and virtualization security issues, related security theories, technologies, methods and evaluation criteria, as well as gain a deeper understanding of computer system security.","name":"操作系统与虚拟化安全","slug":"osvirtsecurity","courseType":"v1.session","instructorIds":["5924526"],"partnerIds":["163"]},{"id":"v1-2771","slug":"sagaspace","instructorIds":["7230764","11070847"],"name":"Sagas and Space - Thinking Space in Viking Age and Medieval Scandinavia","workload":"3-5 hours/week","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/67/308cf0a0b411e49bd7e3c6205d25d1/Carta_Marina_Orca.jpg","partnerIds":["93"],"courseType":"v1.session","description":"Explore with us the fascinating ways of thinking about space in Viking Age and Old Norse culture.

To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life's journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"courseType":"v2.ondemand","slug":"appreciative-inquiry","workload":"","partnerIds":["68"],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"name":"Leading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/17/188300c9c911e5bb056da9bfe7c624/shutterstock_92481034.jpg","instructorIds":["15080644"],"startDate":1456169879026},{"id":"v1-2706","instructorIds":["2083331"],"description":"Learn about the ethics and policy issues that arise in the science and application of synthetic biology, from bioremediation to medicine.

Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts. You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.","name":"Leading Organizations","instructorIds":["11182902"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0b/9d2730402e11e5b08037faca9d869b/vign_mooc3_1200.jpg","partnerIds":["161"],"startDate":1449257104095,"courseType":"v2.ondemand","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"slug":"leading-organizations","workload":"4 weeks, 4 - 5 hours per week","primaryLanguages":["en"]},{"id":"TCVXeIE6EeWJSwoTsapXpQ","name":"International Marketing & Cross Industry Growth Capstone Project  ","startDate":1453238522592,"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"marketing"}],"description":"This course will act as the culmination of the Specialization: International Marketing & Cross Industry Growth.

Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.
