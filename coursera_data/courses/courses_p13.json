For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management. \n\nUsing a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how we think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. \n\nTopics include: the function of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the managerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.","name":"Critical Perspectives on Management","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"}],"startDate":1453482094898,"primaryLanguages":["en"],"instructorIds":["2656811"],"partnerIds":["61"]},{"id":"3TdKKA-VEeWhsgqB1eduww","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"computer-science","subdomainId":"computer-security-and-networks"}],"partnerIds":["220"],"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"Every information service is connected through the Internet.

On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success.  No business can survive without profitable contracts.  Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation, with one module for each step:\n (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy\n (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success\n (3) Close: Create a Contract\n (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game\n\nTo successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to complete the following three steps:\n\n(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes) for the each module. \nThe videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. Videos can be sped up or slowed down to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them.  A student who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.”\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. \nYou can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. Along the way you may find it helpful to use this free mobile app that is related to the course and contains many negotiation planning tools: http://negotiationplanner.com/\n\n(3) Take the final exam. \nTo successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.\n\nAdditionally, this course includes the option of earning a Verified Certificate (VC) through the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course. A VC provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Michigan logo. If you're considering getting a VC, you should complete the verification process before taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or after the exam.

Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.\n\nDo you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? \n\nOrganizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etc… will benefit a lot from this course.\n\nFor the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners.

We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. \n\nThe fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, \"Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition\".  Links to these two texts will be available in the Introduction module.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/genchem1/large-icon.png","workload":"","name":"General Chemistry: Concept Development and Application","primaryLanguages":["en"],"slug":"general-chemistry","instructorIds":["2666905"],"startDate":1434122708460,"partnerIds":["13"]},{"id":"9uthHBq9EeWg_RJGAuFGjw","partnerIds":["190"],"primaryLanguages":["es"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/e146f04aa211e5bee2b7bb80628a69/electrones-ALTA.jpg","workload":"El curso dura 4 semanas y se estima que a los alumnos les tome 4-6 horas/semana.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"physical-science-and-engineering","subdomainId":"electrical-engineering"}],"instructorIds":["10824141","14069574"],"startDate":1444168786395,"description":"Este curso introduce al alumno a la electrónica y los Arduinos, comenzando desde lo más básico de un circuito eléctrico y finalizando con el diseño de circuitos de baja complejidad empleando dispositivos electrónicos programables.

In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high. \n \nSince then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus. \n\nWe're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!","partnerIds":["51"],"name":"Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"clinical-science","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"workload":"20 hours of videos and quizzes","primaryLanguages":["en"],"startDate":1433547260766,"instructorIds":["2687735","2687752","2687763","2687771","2687778","2687782","4663984","5159569"]},{"id":"odfSQ204EeWO3xLloer51Q","instructorIds":["15486079","15516877","13948470"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/64/957690bf9411e5b274b791246c5383/action-resize.jpg","slug":"start-your-own-business-5-capstone","partnerIds":["228"],"workload":"","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"name":"Capstone - Action ","primaryLanguages":["en"],"description":"It is a cliché, but nevertheless very true.

Instead, with this third MOOC, we provide you with different examples  to open your mind to different applications from different industries and sectors.\nThe objective is to give you an helicopter overview on what's happening in this field. You will see how the tools presented in the two previous courses of the Specialization are used in real life projects. \nWe want to ignite your reflection process. Hence, you will best make use of the Accenture cases by watching first the MOOC and then investigate by yourself on the different concepts, industries, or challenges that are introduced during the videos.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to: \n- identify the possible applications of business analytics,\n- hence, reflect on the possible solutions and added-value applications that could be proposed for their capstone project.\n\nThe cases will be presented by senior practitioners from Accenture with different backgrounds in term of industry, function, and country.  Special attention will be paid to the \"value case\" of the issue raised to prepare you for the capstone project of the specialization.\n\nAbout Accenture\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.

An on-going set of challenges is found in the evolution of International Reporting Standards. \n\nThe second module focuses on some recent changes in Standards, identifying the drivers for changes, and examining evolution in controversial areas such as leasing and goodwill. \n\nThe third and final module, Corporate Governance, examines issues which are causing people to re-assess the nature, purpose and scope of corporate governance, and challenges to making governance function effectively. Key issues here are the move to include a broader range of stakeholders, the perennial challenge of agency theory issues, shareholder activism, changing Board structures, and challenges to internal control to better manage risk. \n\nThis MOOC will be right for you if you are interested in engaging with some of the challenges facing finance professionals, even if you are not one yourself.

How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.","slug":"aristotle","primaryLanguages":["en"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/edd320a2a411e5a1f7d940fa69b157/raffael-aristotle.jpg","workload":"5 weeks of study, 1-3 hours/week","name":"Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle and His Successors"},{"id":"xYLZebWrEeWEoAqTi6kTYw","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-strategy"}],"primaryLanguages":["es"],"partnerIds":["58"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3f/fb5810b97f11e5917dabdaee201e54/operaciones_y_calidad.jpg","name":"Introducción a la Calidad","courseType":"v2.ondemand","slug":"gestion-de-productividad","description":"En este curso conoceremos la importancia que tiene implementar estándares de calidad y procesos productivos eficientes, para el desarrollo y continuidad de nuestra empresa o idea de negocio y así mantener su máxima capacidad productiva y seguir ofertando productos con los más altos estándares de calidad, para mantenernos siempre en la preferencia del público.\n\nEs importante resaltar que cuando hablamos de calidad también debemos hacer mención de la capacidad, ubicación y distribución operativa con la que cuenta nuestra empresa o idea de negocio, porque al identificarlas podemos saber qué proceso de calidad es adecuado o cuál está generando deficiencias en la producción para nuestra empresa o idea de negocio.","workload":"","instructorIds":["7240523"],"startDate":1453236173438},{"id":"v1-901","workload":"1-3 hours/week","name":"Global Health and Humanitarianism","partnerIds":["147"],"description":"Is humanitarianism an effective, justifiable and sustainable response to ill-health, inequality, injustice and war?","instructorIds":["5193309","6300359","8117234"],"domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"medicine-and-healthcare","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"startDate":1455494400000,"slug":"health","courseType":"v1.session","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/4c/c045d0d3c711e5b26a63fe18c59f72/globalHealth.jpg","primaryLanguages":["en"]},{"id":"414OIyBREeWcQw5YiljpGw","primaryLanguages":["es"],"partnerIds":["58"],"startDate":1444170123263,"slug":"algebra-basica","courseType":"v2.ondemand","instructorIds":["634879","13630702","13630715"],"name":"Álgebra Básica","workload":"","description":"Galileo dijo: \"El Universo está escrito en lenguaje matemático y los caracteres son triángulos, círculos y otras figuras geométricas, sin las que es humanamente imposible entender una sola palabra\".\n    Para entender el Universo, es necesario plantear leyes que expliquen su comportamiento, como pueden ser las leyes de la gravedad, la propagación del calor, el electromagnetismo, la reproducción celular, el crecimiento poblacional, la propagación de las enfermedades, la variación de los precios de las acciones en la bolsa de valores, el comportamiento de las masas ante un conflicto, etcétera.\n    Todas estas leyes se plantean utilizando ecuaciones, algunas muy sencillas, otras no tanto.
