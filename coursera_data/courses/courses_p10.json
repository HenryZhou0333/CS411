The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\" is the first part of a two part course and it includes the following four lectures: \n(1) What do we need a state for? \n(2) The Relationship between Efficiency and Distributive Justice \n(3) Demonstrating the implications of different ethical theories  \n(4) Distributive Justice: measurement and implications\nOnce you've completed the first part, we strongly recommend that you register for the second part entitled: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - Maximizing Social Well-being\", as well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","startDate":1454610503631,"instructorIds":["4065570"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/d44a90ad3a11e5a1295552b2c67443/Economic-Growth-_-Distributive-Justice.jpg","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"subdomainId":"economics","domainId":"social-sciences"}],"slug":"economic-growth-part-1","workload":"","primaryLanguages":["en"],"partnerIds":["110"]},{"id":"XgJjBB9pEeWS6wrbVw_uEw","courseType":"v2.ondemand","name":"Foundations of Teaching for Learning 3: Learners and Learning","workload":"3-4 hours per week","instructorIds":["3366390","3366373"],"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"education"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"description":"The teacher’s work becomes meaningful when it is informed by research and theories of learning, and their relationship to actual practice.

We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

You'll also learn how to keep yourself safe and be a savvy participant in the global health arena. You'll be prepared to travel and to take your skills to chronic/emergent situations and help respond to the pressing needs while participating in global health activities throughout the world.\n\nWeek one will serve as an introduction to global health concepts with a look at changing trends in the 21st century; urbanization, environmental stress and resource scarcity. During week two, we will dive into global health security: food, water, energy, and the threats of a changing climate. Week three will cover the global burden of disease, infectious disease, the rise of non-communicable diseases, mental health, and access to care. During week four, we will learn about the stakeholders in global health: NGOs, governments, non-state actors; understanding where the money comes from, how it is allocated and the challenges of measuring results; human rights: what are they and how are they protected? During week five, we move onto complex humanitarian emergencies: forced migrations, wars, response standards, and the legal basis for interventions. Finally, during week six, we will end our course by learning how to be an effective participant--caring for yourself: pre-travel preparation, understanding risks when traveling outside your home country, and physiologic vulnerability.\n\nThis course also serves as a prerequisite to the hands-on 'Global Health Responder' certification from the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.   This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.     \n\nWhen done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page.   When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all.    To ensure that your sites do not put up  barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.    Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and  layouts.    \n\nThis is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.

With just a basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will react to common events such as page loads, mouse clicks & movements, and even keyboard input.      \n\nThis course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input.\n\nThis is the third course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class.
