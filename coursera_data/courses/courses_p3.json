What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged."},{"id":"bzK7K9cYEeSV9iIAC0wBBw","startDate":1428345464683,"name":"Communication in the 21st Century Workplace","courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In today's fast-paced business environment, employees at all levels find themselves being asked to handle more tasks, meet more deadlines, take on more responsibilities, and adapt to more change. Added to these challenges is the constantly shifting diversity of the workplace, where coworkers cope with generational, gender, age and cultural differences. Communication, both verbal and nonverbal, is at the foundation of everything we do and say, and is especially important in the 21st century workplace. The good news is that communication is a learned skill, and can be improved upon with the right training. The focus of this course is to heighten students’ awareness of workplace communication, and add new interpersonal skills, with the end result of becoming a more competent communicator overall. Target areas include: the process and functions of communication, behavioral patterns, perceptions as reality, verbal and nonverbal cues and behaviors, confidence, assertiveness, tact, anger management, criticism and constructive feedback, conflict resolution, team building, leadership, interviewing, and communicating more effectively with technology (email, Skype, texting, etc.).","workload":"4-8 hours of videos, readings, and quizzes","slug":"communication-in-the-workplace","partnerIds":["30"],"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/49/13ed1049ad11e4bf3b71daf11b54c7/21st-Century-Communications-Course.jpg","primaryLanguages":["en"],"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"instructorIds":["8883335"]},{"id":"jlAy87ZEEeWddwqLXioIgw","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/41d6809dd811e493f6dbbf8ef7f967/AlgTh_logo.jpg","startDate":1456855464645,"courseType":"v2.ondemand","slug":"algorithmic-thinking-1","description":"Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.

As the central part of the course, students will implement several important graph algorithms in Python and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.\n\nRecommended Background - Students should be comfortable writing intermediate size  (300+ line) programs in Python and have a basic understanding of searching, sorting, and recursion.

Each designer will take on two different design challenges on the fly and address the various issues in designing characters for games, such as movement, expression, and technical limitations.

To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out."},{"id":"v1-126","name":"Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society","description":"Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.\n","domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"design-and-product","domainId":"computer-science"}],"partnerIds":["6"],"courseType":"v1.session","workload":"5-10 hours/week","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/16/5028b0352d11e49acdcfd9c2fca6c5/large-icon.png","primaryLanguages":["en"],"slug":"design","instructorIds":["341966"]},{"id":"WhMdfX8-EeWkMQ6S5uJulw","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c8/b698008a4e11e5a4fe9d45300b6e5a/Contagious-how-things-catch-on-MoocLogo.jpg","name":"Viral Marketing and How to Craft Contagious Content","description":"Ever wondered why some things become popular, and other don't?
