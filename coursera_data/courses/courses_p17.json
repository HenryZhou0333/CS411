Сегодня же секвенирование ДНК стало для специалистов чуть ли не рутинной работой – и тщательное изучение геномов принесло множество сюрпризов. Например, ученые обнаружили в генетическом материале ядерных организмов до 98 % молчащей, не кодирующей белки ДНК. Какие тайны скрываются в этих участках? \nЭтот курс познакомит вас с основными терминами и современными исследованиями в области генетики. От разбора молекулярного носителя наследственности, молекулы ДНК мы  перейдем к подробному изучению ее функциональных единиц – генов. Вы научитесь решать увлекательные генетические задачи и ориентироваться в причинах и последствиях мутаций. Студенты узнают законы классической генетики и столкнутся с тем, что и здесь на каждое правило есть свое исключение.\n\nПочему у голубоглазых родителей не может быть кареглазых детей? \nЧто общего между дальтонизмом у человека и черепаховой окраской у кошек? \nОтчего седеют лошади и не слышит голубоглазый кот? \n\nВместе с учеными-генетиками мы ответим на эти и другие вопросы и увидим, какие серьезные изменения в эволюционной биологии и биомедицине произошли сегодня благодаря появлению современных методов исследования ДНК.\n\nНаш курс состоит из пяти модулей, название и структуру которых вы можете видеть ниже.

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n•\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n•\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n•\tExplain elasticity of demand.\n•\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.","slug":"firm-level-economics","name":"Firm Level Economics: Consumer and Producer Behavior","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/50/80fa20a03c11e5ad000de4f911bf97/iMBA_MEABA_Icon_FirmLevelEconomics.png","instructorIds":["16631679"],"primaryLanguages":["en"]},{"id":"EVxWU6_bEeSmUyIACymLoA","partnerIds":["60"],"startDate":1432168530388,"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/61a0fd462aa2524f71915233b3530b/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"},{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"history"}],"courseType":"v2.ondemand","workload":"12-24 hours of videos and quizzes","description":"The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road.

Building upon that foundation, the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.\n\nPace: \nThere are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual “modules” lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of “concept check” questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.\n\nIt is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.","instructorIds":["11749674"],"domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"biology","domainId":"life-sciences"}],"partnerIds":["12"],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"startDate":1427740236980,"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/cryoem/cryo-em_banner_model_no_blur.jpg"},{"id":"s4CUmzCqEeWPngoW78wA_Q","name":"The Modern World, Part Two: Global History since 1910","description":"This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective.

Город Томск: курс русского языка для иностранцев» ответит на вопросы, которые часто задают иностранцы о Сибири: Чем она богата? Каковы ее природные и климатические условия? Что за люди здесь живут, чем они занимаются? Как устроен сибирский город, сибирская деревня? Какие народности проживают на территории Томска и Томской области? Как поддерживаются национальные традиции? Как сохраняется деревянная архитектура? Кто из томских студентов принимал участие в Олимпийских играх? \n\nКурс может быть интересен \n- иностранным гражданам, которые хотят совершенствовать русский язык;\n- бывшим россиянам, проживающим сейчас за рубежом и интересующимся тем, как живет Сибирь сегодня; \n- преподавателям русского языка как иностранного; \n- иностранным студентам, выбирающим город, в котором хотели бы обучаться на русском языке;\n- российским школьным учителям и выпускникам российских школ.\n\nВ этом курсе слушатели смогут практиковаться в разных видах речевой деятельности на русском языке (аудирование, чтение, письмо); расширить словарный запас, в том числе за счет лексики, которая, как правило, не встречается в распространенных учебных пособиях по русскому языку как иностранному; улучшить грамматические навыки.\n\nПосле завершения курса слушатели смогут применить свои страноведческие знания о Сибири при изучении истории России, лингвострановедения России, русской культуры. Приобретенные знания и навыки будут полезны иностранным гражданам во время путешествий по России.  \n\nThe course will give answers to the questions about Siberia that are frequently asked by foreigners: What is it rich in? What its nature and climate conditions? What people live here and what do they do? How is a Siberian town or a village organized? What nationalities live on the territory of Tomsk and Tomsk region? How national traditions are maintained? How the wooden architecture is being preserved? What Tomsk students took part at the Olympic games?\nThis course will provide learners with an opportunity to practice different types of speech activity in Russian (listening, reading, and writing); to enrich their vocabulary with lexical units that are not typical in manuals “Russian as a foreign language”; to improve their grammar skills.\nOn completing the course the learners will be able to use their knowledge about Siberia in such subjects as the history of Russia, Russian language and area studies, and Russian culture. These skills and knowledge will be useful for foreign citizens who travel around Russia.","name":"Зарисовки о Сибири.

Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model."},{"id":"v1-28","name":"Listening to World Music","partnerIds":["6"],"instructorIds":["235007"],"slug":"worldmusic","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/47/cee7a0352d11e4ae1bdd88b9e8f59b/large-icon.png","courseType":"v1.session","description":"Learn the ideas and vocabulary for listening to world music, and examine the music of several world music cultures and how they have entered into mainstream popular culture.","primaryLanguages":["en"],"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"arts-and-humanities","subdomainId":"music-and-art"}],"workload":"5-7 hours/week"},{"id":"Hc_NtRVGEeWhTg59fTWfpQ","startDate":1456164057046,"description":"You will never know whether you have an effective user experience until you have tested it with users.

Its sheltered life has allowed it to reduce its genome to only about 160,000 base pairs. With only about 200 genes, it lacks some genes necessary for survival, but these genes are supplied by its insect host. In fact, Carsonella has such a small genome that biologists have conjectured that it is losing its “bacterial” identity and turning into an organelle, which is part of the host’s genome. This transition from bacterium to organelle has happened many times during evolutionary history; in fact, the mitochondrion responsible for energy production in human cells was once a free-roaming bacterium that we assimilated in the distant past. Given a collection of simulated error-free read-pairs, use the paired de Bruijn graph to reconstruct the Carsonella ruddii genome. Compare this assembly to the assembly obtained from the classic de Bruijn graph (i.e., when all we know is the reads themselves and do not know the distance between paired reads) in order to better appreciate the benefits of read-pairs.
