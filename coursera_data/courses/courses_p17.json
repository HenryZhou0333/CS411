From credit card transactions and online shopping carts, to customer loyalty programs and user-generated ratings/reviews, there is a staggering amount of data that can be used to describe our past buying behaviors, predict future ones, and prescribe new ways to influence future purchasing decisions. In this brand new course, four of Wharton\u2019s top marketing professors will dive deeper into the key areas of customer analytics: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and their application to real-world business practices including Amazon, Google, and Starbucks to name a few. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand how data is used to describe, explain, and predict customer behavior; best practices for using this data to prescribe more effective business strategies; and how successful companies are currently using such data to meet (and shape) customer needs, and to increase their bottom line in the process.  This course has been designed to help you make better business decisions about emerging data structures, so that you can apply what you\u2019ve learned to your own company or business today.\u00a0",

Taught by one of the world\u2019s leading experts in the field, this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will examine unique modes of international criminal liability and specialized defenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.\n\n-- Course Syllabus --\n\nThis course comprises eight units (or \"modules\"). Each will include an assigned reading, typically an article or book chapter, as well as a simulation designed to bring the readings to life.\n\nI will also offer video lectures on each of the topics, accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be online role-play exercises and debates, enabling the students to share their own insights. \n\nThe order of class sessions will be:\n\n(1)     History: From Nuremberg to The Hague\n\n(2)     International Crimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture\n\n(3)     International Crimes Part 2: Terrorism and Piracy\n\n(4)     Special modes of liability: command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement\n\n(5)      Special defenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity\n\n(6)      Gaining custody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing\n\n(7)      Pre-Trial Issues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence\n\n(8)      Maintaining control of the courtroom    \n\n-- Recommended Background --\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a lawyer and there are no prerequisites for this course. However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. \n\n-- Suggested Readings --\n\nStudents should read the assigned online materials for each unit in advance of the class session.  \n\nIn addition, students are invited to subscribe to \u201cWar Crimes Prosecution Watch,\u201d a free bi-weekly e-newsletter that summarizes the latest developments in the field of international criminal law.\n\n-- Course Format --\n\nThis course is made up of eight content units. Each unit is based on an online reading assignment, a video lecture of about one hour in length, and one or more role play exercises to stimulate on-line discussion. The course also offers in-video enrichment quizzes (ungraded) for each unit, a ten question multiple choice midterm diagnostics exam (ungraded), and a ten question True/False Final Exam.   \n\n-- FAQ--\n\nHow will this course be graded? \n\nThis course is graded on completion. In order to complete the course each student must: (1) finish each module (or \u201clesson\u201d); (2) write at least one essay response of 200 words or more for at least one simulation throughout the course; and (3) get a score of 6 out of 10 or better on the Final Exam.\n\nWhat resources will I need for this course?\n\nFor this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read and discuss the exciting materials available online.\n\nWhat is the coolest thing about this course?\n\nThe topics we will be discussing are ripped from the headlines.  The topics are often controversial and thought-provoking, and always exciting.",

While the course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that in other parts of the world, the nature of the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors may not be the same. Nevertheless,it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/oyL82q\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 2 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions to be explored this week are: What is the board's role in planning for the organization's future and why is it important for nonprofit organizations to do it? What is strategic planning and what can boards do to carry this out effectively? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions: What is the board's role in assessing the performance of the organization? Why is performance assessment important? Why do many boards have difficulty meeting their performance assessment responsibilities? \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What are the elements of the fundraising/resource development process? What is the board's role in ensuring the organization has adequate funding? What information should be in a resource development plan? \n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners!  \n\nYou and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress at a mid-point Peer Review.  At the mid-point you will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping your fellow Learners gauge their own progress.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to their work, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.  \n\nWhen the Capstone Projects are ready to be finalized and shared, you will have another opportunity for Peer Review.  This final  opportunity for sharing your photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience.  Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  \n\nA unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment:  LensPen, Lume Cube lighting, Photo District News,  Schneider Optics, Think Tank Cases/Bags, and a 1-year membership in PhotoVideoEdu.com providing special student discounts from 16 more major manufacturers. The 'top-10' peer-reviewed Capstone projects each year will be awarded the opportunity for individual reviews, with personal responses, by world renowned photographers who have been honored with the title of Canson-Infinity\u00ae Ambassadors.",

The focus will then move to less popular markets such as gold, emerging markets, real estate, hedge funds and private markets. These will be analyzed with an emphasis on their particular risks and return opportunities as well as how they can help in building efficient portfolios. Finally, the policies of central banks and their impact on financial markets will be presented to you along with the link between the economy and the price of financial assets.\n\nAll along these different steps, experts from UBS, our corporate partner, will show you how the concepts you just acquired are effectively applied in a leading global bank. This focus on practicality means you will not only understand what is going on in global financial markets but also start to figure out how you can use them to achieve financial goals, be it a client's or your own.",

Given this, it's not difficult to see that the task quickly becomes complex.\n\nThe objective of this course is twofold: first, we will focus on contemporary challenges that managers and entrepreneurs in food and beverage businesses should be able to face; and second, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nThis course is made up of four modules and an introduction, each exploring one dilemma that food and beverage companies face. You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers. These lectures combine an accessible introduction to specific topics integrated with interviews of managers and experts that will give precious insights and examples to the participants.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience with us, we will make a Documentary on the Excellences of the Modena District available for you, which is in a format that we have developed specifically for this course in order to give you the chance to experience first-hand the territory as our on-campus students usually do.\n\nEach module is paired with an evaluated quiz and weekly discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the F&B world, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\n\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy.\n\nBelow the guest speakers of the course:\n\nMasterchef Italia Sky \u2013 Nils Hartmann, Head of Movie Channels at Sky Italia \u2013 www.masterchef.sky.it\nEataly - Paolo Bongiovanni, Marketing Director Italy \u2013 www.eataly.net\nBerlucchi \u2013 Paolo Ziliani, Owner \u2013 www.berlucchi.it\nJoia Restaurant \u2013 Alta Cucina Naturale \u2013 Pietro Leemann, Owner and Chef \u2013 www.joia.it\nBranca \u2013 Nicol\u00f2 Branca, Owner \u2013 www.branca.it\nBarilla \u2013 Giuseppe Morici, President Region Europe \u2013 www.barilla.com\nProyecto Expo 2015 Chile \u2013 Guillermo Ariztia, Chile Pavillon Director \u2013 www.expomilan.cl\nWinery Il Cavallante, Milano \u2013 Sergio Morpurgo, Owner\nHeineken \u2013 Floris Cobelens, Marketing Director \u2013 www.heineken.com\nTRDN \u2013 Martin Oetting, Managing Director \u2013 www.trnd.com\nGROM \u2013 Federico Grom, Owner and Founder \u2013 www.grom.it/en\nTetra Pak \u2013 Matthew Hatton, Director Competitor Intelligence \u2013 www.tetrapak.com\nBioHombre \u2013 Matteo Panini, CEO \u2013 www.hombre.it\nAcetaia Maletti \u2013 Carmen & Claudio Maletti\nCantine Riunite & CIV \u2013 Vanni Lusetti, CEO; Francesca Benini, Sales & Marketing Manager; Elena Lottici, Export Manager; Mario Vandi, Brand Manager \u2013 www.riunite.it\nGlemGas \u2013 Marco Guerzoni, Program Product Manager \u2013 www.glemgas.com\nBibendum Catering \u2013 LaFranceschetta58 \u2013 Sabrina Lazzereschi & Marta Pulini, Owners and Founders \u2013 www.bibendumcatering.it , www.franceschetta58.it\n\nDISCLAIMER - Since most of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and the subtitles.",

Throughout the MOOC we'll focus on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked programming in the context of Android middleware systems programming mechanisms, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, and local/remote inter-process communication (IPC) and HTTP. We illustrate by example how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied in Android Services and various local and remote IPC mechanisms from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with a case study project used to reify the key points throughout all the modules in this MOOC.",

In addition, you will learn about the basic building blocks of security\u2014encryption and cryptographic systems\u2014along with how these can be used to build a sound user authentication system. More importantly, you will be able to use this knowledge to evaluate off-the-shelf authentication packages, and better understand the options they provide. You will learn about the SSL/HTTPS protocols, and how to enable them in your web applications to support encrypted communication between the browser and web server. You will also learn how to use authorization and access control in your web applications in order to ensure that users are only able to access the data they are entitled to view.

            "description": "This class covers the fundamental principles underlying cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) starting with the basic anatomy of electron microscopes, an introduction to Fourier transforms, and the principles of image formation. Building upon that foundation, the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.\n\nPace: \nThere are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual \u201cmodules\u201d lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of \u201cconcept check\u201d questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.\n\nIt is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.",

Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.\n\nWe will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: probability distributions, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. \n\nFor those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisher\u2019s exact test, simple regression (linear, exponential en logistic) and multiple regression, one way and multi-way analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test).",

Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.",

With only about 200 genes, it lacks some genes necessary for survival, but these genes are supplied by its insect host. In fact, Carsonella has such a small genome that biologists have conjectured that it is losing its \u201cbacterial\u201d identity and turning into an organelle, which is part of the host\u2019s genome. This transition from bacterium to organelle has happened many times during evolutionary history; in fact, the mitochondrion responsible for energy production in human cells was once a free-roaming bacterium that we assimilated in the distant past. Given a collection of simulated error-free read-pairs, use the paired de Bruijn graph to reconstruct the Carsonella ruddii genome. Compare this assembly to the assembly obtained from the classic de Bruijn graph (i.e., when all we know is the reads themselves and do not know the distance between paired reads) in order to better appreciate the benefits of read-pairs. For each k, what is the minimum value of d needed to enable reconstruction of the entire Carsonella ruddii genome from its (k, d)-mer composition?",

In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium.\n\n",

With the guidance of the course team, you will be asked to use these ideas to critically reflect on your own understandings and experience. By the end of the course, you will have developed a personal response to the main question: what is your preferred future for education?\n\n\n\nAnnouncement for US based teachers:\n\nCoursera and its partners are proud to offer eligible teachers free verified certificates for this course and other high-quality teacher professional development courses, through the ConnectED effort announced by President Obama.\n\nTo participate in this opportunity, district leaders simply need to approve Coursera teacher professional development by completing a brief form at: www.coursera.org/tpd.\n\nTeachers interested in this opportunity are also encouraged to follow the link to learn more and complete the form.  \n\nOnce a district\u2019s form has been verified, the district leader will be notified and teachers in the district will receive access to free verified certificates for Coursera professional development.\n\nCoursera and its partners thank educators for the hard work they do every day and hope this opportunity will allow them to continue developing their craft in a meaningful and flexible way.\n\nParticipation in or completion of this online course will not confer academic credit for University of London programmes",

The second course teaches whether the clinician will or will not find value from deploying a new innovation.  The third course identifies the competitive landscape of medical technology innovations to compete or complement.  The fourth course, teaches how to put a monetary value on the improvement in health resulting from a new innovation.  The summary of these elements creates a document of high strategic value where the learner has demonstrated not only an understanding of the marketplace but what is required for the marketplace to advance. This is what is accomplished during the Healthcare Marketplace capstone experience.",

Esta materia utiliza una pedagog\u00eda basada en la investigaci\u00f3n y preguntas para entender las relaciones entre pa\u00edses en el entorno global de negocios. Se examina el entorno empresarial global al hacer y responder a preguntas claves: Las preguntas son: 1 \u00bfComo se determinan los Tipos de Cambio?,  2. \u00bfComo debe estructurar su empresa internacional? 3. \u00bfComo puede adaptar su producto o servicio para el mercado global? 4. \u00bfComo es trabajar en otro pa\u00eds o administrar expatriados? 5. \u00bfComo puede empezar, administrar y crecer una empresa peque\u00f1a en mercados en el exterior? 6. \u00bfComo esta el Entorno Global de Negocios? Este enfoque basado en la investigaci\u00f3n y preguntas genera oportunidades de reflexi\u00f3n para que los alumnos comprendan mejor el entorno global en el que operan las empresas. Los videos se entregan de una manera cautivador, que fomenta la reflexi\u00f3n y la investigaci\u00f3n. Las clases ser\u00e1n impartidas por el instructor en el espa\u00f1ol y en el Ingl\u00e9s.",
