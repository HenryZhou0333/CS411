That journey continues even today and we call it the Kennedy legacy. \n\nThis course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how JFK\u2019s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.\n\nUnderstanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.    \n    \nNovember 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy\u2019s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy\u2019s influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects? \n\nWe\u2019ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century. \n\nFollow on Twitter: @JFKclass.",
