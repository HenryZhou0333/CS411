Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they've hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland's attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we've learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every module. Instead, the lectures will be relatively short in length and will have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/02/6833219a4722f01632407f5265c508/Beyond-Silcon-Valley-Logo.jpg","workload":"1.5 hours of videos","name":"Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies","instructorIds":["5333149"],"startDate":1420488663168,"domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"}],"partnerIds":["68"],"primaryLanguages":["en"],"slug":"entrepreneurship-development"},{"id":"MuBe7XEiEeWcvArDJYZj9Q","photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2f/2bc540b2c411e5bc793bb6b305a033/maital-coursera-C.jpg","courseType":"v2.ondemand","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"entrepreneurship"},{"domainId":"personal-development","subdomainId":"personal-development"}],"partnerIds":["129"],"startDate":1453237095962,"description":"Part Three offers Life Lessons from a Master Innovator, with proven achievements.

You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership. \nWeek 2 - Navigating Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture, culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence. \nWeek 3 - Communication. Communication and its impact on leadership identity and relationships, managing communication to improve decision making, steps for developing your intercultural communication skills.\nWeek 4 - Motivation. Views on individual motivation, cultural differences in motivation, developing motivation and commitment in teams.\nWeek 5 - Networking.

Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.","courseType":"v2.ondemand","startDate":1444930989383,"photoUrl":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/66/9d5e308eb020f72db558021530c4d6/muslim_democracy.jpg","primaryLanguages":["en"],"domainTypes":[{"subdomainId":"law","domainId":"social-sciences"},{"domainId":"social-sciences","subdomainId":"governance-and-society"}],"workload":"8-12 hours/week","name":"Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World","partnerIds":["63"]},{"id":"CuQpLnQ9EeWrAxJQXw-8PQ","startDate":1453239357672,"name":"Coaching Practices","domainTypes":[{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"leadership-and-management"},{"domainId":"business","subdomainId":"business-essentials"}],"courseType":"v2.ondemand","description":"In this course, you will explore the coaching practices managers use to create a culture of accountability.
