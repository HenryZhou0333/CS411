Porter        began his career in private industry and a \nmechanical engineer        focused on heating and cooling. But a \nrestless intellect led        Porter back to academia and to the \nUniversity of Florida, where        he earned his PhD in agricultural \nand biological engineering.        Porter now works in sustainable \nconstruction practices and structures        that conserve energy and \nresources. He teaches courses in these        areas in the Agricultural \nOperations Management curriculum. His        combination of ready wit \nand engineering precision makes him        a popular and effective \nteacher.</p>\n            <p>Porter's research focuses on        understanding \nconstruction in specialized applications not covered        in standard \nconstruction programs. First, Porter is interested        in Florida's \nunique environment. Most of the United States lies        in a temperate\n climate zone, and many standard building practices        are based on \nthe the requirements of these areas. However, Florida's        \nsubtropical climate, with its heat and humidity, poses unique        \nchallenges and presents special opportunities. Second, Porter        \nworks on structures used in agricultural settings, which must        be \nadapted to many specific environments and working requirements.</p>\n            <p>Florida construction styles        were perfected over \nmany generations of coping with the hot,        humid climate, sandy \nsoils, and high water tables. For example,        Porter is currently \nengaged in a research project concerning        crawl space ventilation.\n Standard building practices from northern        areas would dictate \nsealing the space to exclude humidity. Floridians        have learned \nover the years that the best idea is to ventilate        these spaces \nand allow the daily patterns of humidity and wind        to work \ntogether naturally to keep structures dry and prevent        the growth \nof rotting molds. Understanding the daily cycles of        heat and \nhumidity is critical to designing effective buildings        in Florida.\n Otherwise, improperly designed buildings will \"fight\"        with the \nclimate, require more complex and more expensive mechanical        \nsolutions, and will be predisposed to sick-building syndromes.</p>\n            <p>Regarding his work with resource-efficient        \nhousing, Porter describes the extensive work done in northern        \nEuropean countries on so-called \"passive houses,\" in        which \nconstruction materials and techniques result in a highly        \nenergy-efficient structure that has extremely low heat-loss and        \nhas a positive heat gain even in winter. Many of these homes        do \nnot even have central heating systems because the reuse of        heat \nwithin the home and passive solar sources are sufficient        to \nmaintain a comfortable temperature year-round. These are designs        \nfor temperate climates that do not work in high humidity, but        \nPorter adapts ideas from projects like the passive house and        many\n other sources for application in Florida's climate.</p>\n            <p>Porter points out that the        key to many energy \nefficiencies starts with how contractors are        trained to build. \nBuyers and contractors have to start with an        agreement that \nlong-term savings are worth additional up-front        costs. The \nlong-term savings can be impressive, and the time        it takes to \nrecover and surpass the costs of energy-efficient        construction \nneed not be that long. The workshops that Porter        conducts for \nbuilders train them in energy-efficient construction        techniques \nand can give them a competitive advantage in attracting        potential\n buyers. Of course, buyers have to be educated as well,        and \nPorter has produced a number of publications to help homeowners        \nunderstand many aspects of energy efficiency, including more        \nefficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, windows, lighting,   \n     and more.</p>\n            <p>Resource-efficiency is also        important in \nagriculture, and Porter's research becomes part        of his teaching. \nIn his agricultural construction classes, students        are exposed to\n the latest in \"green\" construction materials        and techniques. But\n Porter also likes to balance the latest information        with the \ntried and true.</p>\n            <p>In Porter's construction classes,        students learn \nabout the types and uses of agricultural structures.        The course \ncovers building materials, tools, and techniques.        They learn \nabout building codes and management skills needed        in maintaining a\n physical plant. Porter complements the intellectual        learning \nexperience with hands-on training. In the laboratory        that goes \nwith the course, students have weekly design challenges        in which \nthey practice the basics of all major building systems,        including\n framing, plumbing, electrical, window selection and        \ninstallation, and more. During the semester, the class will undertake   \n     a full-scale building project. Students work in teams and are      \n  supported by department staff who are expert in agricultural        \nconstruction and maintenance.</p>\n            <p>Porter says that too often        the \"physical\" side of \neducation, which exploits the        connection between hand, eye, and \nbrain, is overlooked, and that        it has many rewards. Many of \nPorter's students have never built        anything, and as managers, it \nis important that they have an        appreciation for the projects and \nworkers they will oversee.        Students working in teams develop \ncamaraderie. They have the        fulfillment of working with their \nhands and making something.        The skills they learn in this lab \nwill have many uses throughout        their lives. Through these very \ntangible experiences, they build        confidence.</p>\n            <p>While Porter believes that        this kind of technical \ntraining is an essential counterpart to         what students learn in \nclass, he clarifies that this is not        a trade school or a shop \nclass. His emphasis is always on management        and decision making. \nFor example, he wants his students to have        the hand skills of \ndeveloping a sketch and filling it out with        accurate dimensions, \nbut they will not learn to draw a blueprint.        What they need in \nthis regard as managers is the ability to communicate        their ideas\n clearly and correctly through drawings.</p>\n            <p>In all of this, students observe        and practice the \nmanagement of projects -- the central goal of        their curriculum. \nPorter says that students learn all the basics        of being a \nmanager, such as how to eat \"big doses of humble        pie\", how to \nmanage a team rather than doing everything        yourself, and how to \ntreat people that work for you (and often        have insight and skills\n that you do not) with the respect they        deserve. </p><br>","fullName":"","title":"","department":"Agricultural and Biological Engineering"},{"id":"6407572","photo":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-instructor-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/18/122f80d97a11e4ba10cb62bd5c0779/alanmiller.png","bio":"<p><span>Alan Miller is an\ninternationally recognized authority on climate finance and policy.&nbsp; His clients include UNDP, US AID, and ADB.
