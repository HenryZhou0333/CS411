After a pleasant year teaching at the University of Kentucky in Lexington (1972-1973), Wright moved to Yale, serving as chair of the Department of Music from 1986-1992 and becoming the Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Music in 2006. At the undergraduate level he teaches a basic music appreciation course (one of Yale\u2019s largest) and the music history course required of majors in Medieval and Renaissance music. His music appreciation course, \u201cListening to Music\u201d is currently the fourth most popular online course in China.&nbsp; At Yale, Wright has also developed an interdisciplinary course, \u201cExploring the Nature of Genius,\u201d which has attracted a strong following in Yale\u2019s Humanities program.&nbsp; Recently, he has turned his professional research away from early music to Mozart and the concept of genius.</p><p>Wright\u2019s writing in music history began with a rigorously primary-source approach\u2014the first-hand study in situ of the music manuscripts and archival documents of Western Europe as they pertain to early music. In the course of time he has expanded his view to a broadly interdisciplinary one, as the title of his most recent book suggests:&nbsp;The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology and Music. His interests have also extended chronologically, and his publications now range from studies of the music of Leoninus (died ca. 1200) to Bach. He is one of the few individuals to be awarded the Dent medal (RMA), the Einstein prize (AMS), and the Kinkeldey award (AMS). He also has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and an NEH Fellowship. In 2004 Wright was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago, and in 2010 he was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>",

He was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, where he held the position of Distinguished McKnight University Professor and Vincentine Hermes-Luh Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently he is with Duke University. His awards include the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 1998, the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientist and Engineers (PECASE) in 1998 (awarded in the White House by President Clinton), the National Science Foundation Career Award in 1999, the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship in 2010, and the Test of Time Award in 2011 for his paper on image segmentation. His algorithms appear in Adobe\u2019s products, leading medical imaging packages such as ITK, and are also roaming on Mars. He has been teaching image processing for over 15 years and delivered numerous invited plenary talks and short courses at leading imaging and applied mathematics conferences. G.

For many years, he served as the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies in the College of Engineering and later as the Director of the University Honors Program that serves students from a wide spectrum of majors. Dr. Shackelford also served as Associate Director for Education for the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST) and as Faculty Assistant to the Director of the McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC) of UC Davis. He teaches and conducts research in the structural characterization and processing of materials, focusing on glasses and biomaterials.  His current focus in teaching is doing so through online technologies. A member of the American Ceramic Society and ASM International, he was named a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society in 1992, was named a Fellow of ASM International in 2011, and received the Outstanding Educator Award of the American Ceramic Society in 1996. In 2003, he received a Distinguished Teaching Award from the Academic Senate of the University of California, Davis. In 2012, he received the Outstanding Teaching Award of the College of Engineering at UC Davis, and, in 2014, received an Outstanding Service Award from UC Davis Extension.

            "bio": "My research interests have two parallel elements. First, I use the epidemiologic framework to explain the risk factors, natural history, and consequences of major mental disorders. Second, I take the sociologic approach to understand the occurrence of the subset of bizarre behaviors that generally are labeled as psychiatric disorders. In the area of psychiatric epidemiology, I have conducted research on the incidence and natural history of schizophrenia using data from psychiatric case registers in several locations around the world. At the current time&nbsp;research focuses on the relationship of autoimmune diseases to&nbsp;risk for autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. I have investigated common mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder and the anxiety disorders, in the context of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Followup, a twenty year cohort study. A somewhat surprising finding from that study was the degree to which major depressive disorder was predictive of the new occurrence of important physical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer. The current phase of the ECA project is a collaboration with four ECA sites linking data on mental disorders to the National Death Index, in the largest population-based study of this topic in the United States to date.",
