His laboratory uses both experimental and modeling techniques to study the biophysical properties of synapses and neurons and the population dynamics of large networks of neurons. New computational models and new analytical tools have been developed to understand how the brain represents the world and how new representations are formed through learning algorithms for changing the synaptic strengths of connections between neurons. He has published over 500 scientific papers and 12 books, including The Computational Brain, with Patricia Churchland.&nbsp; He is a member of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, one of only 10 living persons to be a member of all 3 national academies.<br><br>Sejnowski received his PhD in physics from Princeton University and was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and on the faculty at the Johns Hopkins University.

Before coming to Emory, he taught at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.<br><br>As an American with a European education, he is widely known for his ability to blend a wide range of historical, religious, and geographical perspectives on the Bible. His writing and teaching are thoroughly interdisciplinary, demonstrating how the ideas of the Bible and other ancient writings bear directly on central problems that face our societies in modern times. He brings to his work first-hand acquaintance with archeological finds and primary sources from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. As a testimony to his distinctive interdisciplinary approach to biblical studies, he recently received a full Faculty Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which had not been awarded in biblical studies for many years prior. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jacob Wright writes on an array of topics, ranging from social life in ancient Israel (feasting, war commemoration, urbicide, etc.) to the formation of biblical writings. His first book, <i>Rebuilding Identity: The Nehemiah Memoir and Its Earliest Readers</i> (De Gruyter), won the prestigious Templeton Award for first books in religion.&nbsp;His current research treats a wide range of phenomena related to war and society in ancient Israel.&nbsp;Most recently he has written <i><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/king-david-his-reign-revisited/id741571300?mt=11\" target=\"_blank\">King David and His Reign Revisited</a>&nbsp;</i>(Aldina Media) and <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/David-Israel-Caleb-Biblical-Memory/dp/1107672635\" target=\"_blank\">David, King of Israel, and Caleb in Biblical Memory</a>&nbsp;</i>(Cambridge University Press).<br><br>At Emory, he teaches a wide variety of courses related to biblical studies: The Biblical Covenant and Its Afterlives\u2014An Introduction to Political Theology; War and Society in Ancient Israel; Texts of Terror\u2014Strategies for Interpreting Troublesome Texts from the Hebrew Bible; Judah and Judeans During the Persian Period; Methods of Biblical Interpretation; individual books such as Judges, Jeremiah, and 1-2 Samuel; and ancient Semitic languages such as Aramaic and Akkadian. <br>",

In his thesis work, he discovered five novel mammalian members of the bHLH-PAS family, termed MOP1-5 for members of PAS superfamily (Hogenesch et al., JBC, 1997). Characterization revealed one of the orphans, BMAL1/MOP3, was the partner of a related bHLH-PAS member, Clock, a master regulator of circadian (Hogenesch, et. al, PNAS, 1998). This circuitry comprises the positive arm of the&nbsp;mammalian circadian clock. In 1999 he joined the laboratory of Steve Kay at the Scripps Research Institute and the Novartis Research Foundation as a postdoctoral fellow. At GNF, he worked on the assembly of the complete mammalian transcriptomes (Hogenesch et al., Cell, 2001), as well as on the mRNA characterization of their expression (Su et al, PNAS 2002; Su et al., PNAS, 2004). Current interests include the development of genome wide methodologies for the study of cellular pathways using cDNAs and siRNAs (Conkright et al., Molecular Cell, 2003; Sato et al, Neuron, 2004 ; Willingham et al., Science, 2005; Sato et al., Nature Genetics, 2006; Zhang et al., Cell, 2009; Baggs et al., PLoS Biology, 2009). &nbsp;In 2006, Dr. Hogenesch joined the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine as an Associate Professor, and is now Professor of Pharmacology, Associate Director of the Penn Genomics Institute, and Interim Director of the Institute for Biomedical Informatics. &nbsp;Dr. Hogenesch currently sits on the Scientific Advisory Boards of Qiagen, Bio-Rad, and the Ryan Licht Sang Foundation Medical Committee, and is an advisor to several National Institutes of Health, NIDDK, NCI, NHLBI.&nbsp;",
