Dr. Jayarao received his Bachelor of Veterinary Science degree from the Bombay Veterinary College in Mumbai, India, in 1980 and went on to receive his Master of Veterinary Science in Veterinary Public Health from Bombay Veterinary College in 1982. For 6 years (1980-1986) Dr. Jayarao practiced small and large animal medicine in Mumbai.  In 1990, Dr. Jayarao received his PhD in Veterinary Public Health from the University of Veterinary Sciences in Budapest, Hungary, and in 1994 his Master of Public Health in Occupational and Environmental Health, from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, TN.  \n\nThe central theme of Dr. Jayarao's diagnostic, extension and research programs at Penn State is Veterinary Public Health. He has taken a lead role in developing extension education and research programs including quality milk production (Pennsylvania Quality Milk Program), food safety (foodborne pathogens in raw milk), emerging infectious diseases (Avian Influenza; antibiotic resistant bacteria), agrosecurity (foreign animal diseases; agro-terrorism) and occupational health (zoonotic diseases acquired in animal occupational settings). The Pennsylvania Quality Milk Program has received both national and international recognition as an excellent extension program, and is widely acknowledged as a successful model for \u201ctranslational research\u201d (translating laboratory research findings to practical field applications). The Pennsylvania Quality Milk Program (2000-present), has accounted for nearly 65 state wide extension meetings, 6 national and international workshops, 12 peer reviewed publications, 16 proceedings and abstracts, over 195 consultations with dairy producers, veterinarians and other agriculture professionals, 3 competitive research grants, and a web-based software tool that predicts raw milk quality.  \n\nDr. Jayarao's extension education interests have crossed over into classroom didactic teaching venues. He has developed two courses; 1) Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, and 2) Molecular Epidemiology.  Dr. Jayarao has advised public health agencies and laboratories in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and India on emerging infectious diseases. Dr. Jayarao has been involved in administrative roles with the USDA and AVMA.

She holds secondary appointments in the Departments of Physical Therapy, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Microbiology &Molecular Genetics. In addition, she is a faculty member of the neurology residency program in the Department of Physical Therapy. Dr. Ambrosio graduated with a Master of Science in Physiology-Endocrinology with a specialization in skeletal muscle physiology from Laval University in Que\u0301bec City, Que\u0301bec. She also graduated with a Master of Physical Therapy from the Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2005, Dr. Ambrosio completed her PhD in Rehabilitation Science & Technology from the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Ambrosio's research has the long-term goal of developing Regenerative Rehabilitation approaches to improve the skeletal muscle healing and functional recovery. Her laboratory uses murine and human models to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which targeted and specific mechanotransductive signals can be used to enhance donor and/or host stem cell functionality. Dr. Ambrosio's research has been supported by the NIH, the DOD, the Foundation for Physical Therapy, the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center, and the University of Pittsburgh Institute on Aging, among others. Dr. Ambrosio has published and recorded several educational modules on the topic of Regenerative Rehabilitation and has assumed national leadership roles in several work group efforts to promote the integration of regenerative medicine technologies with rehabilitation approaches. She is the Founding Course Director of the Annual International Symposium on Regenerative Rehabilitation. She is also the Founding Director of the International Consortium for Regenerative Rehabilitation, which includes seven participating institutions representing North America, Europe, and Asia.",
