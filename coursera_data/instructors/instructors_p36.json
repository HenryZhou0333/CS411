Professor Porter earned his undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of San Diego (2000), and his Masters and Ph.D in computer science from UC San Diego (2006 and 2011, respectively).  He was an Assistant Professor at Skidmore College for three years, prior to joining the faculty at UC San Diego in 2014.  Advised by Professor Dean Tullsen, his Ph.D. is in Computer Architecture (high-level processor design) where he focused on improving single-thread performance in the Multi-Core era.  Although still active in computer architecture, he is now primarily focused on computer science education research where his emphasis is on identifying core course concepts which are essential to student success, developing pedagogies which facilitate student engagement with those concepts, and creating assessment instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of those pedagogical practices. His research, funded by several National Science Foundation grants, has earned the Best Student Paper award at the International Conference on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) in 2011, the Best Paper Award at the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Technical Symposium in 2013, and the Chair’s Award at the International Computing Education Research Conference (ICER) in 2014.  He also earned the Skidmore College President’s Award for his co-development of interdisciplinary classes designed to improve scientific literacy.  Most importantly, Professor Porter loves teaching and working with students; he has taught a wide array of courses including Introductory Programming in Java, Data Structures, Computer Organization, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Teaching Methods in Computer Science.","fullName":"Leo Porter","title":"Assistant Teaching Professor","department":"Computer Science and Engineering"},{"id":"3071826","bio":"","fullName":"","title":"","department":""},{"id":"3344145","bio":"","fullName":"","title":"","department":""},{"id":"5247080","bio":"","fullName":"","title":"","department":""},{"id":"3799423","bio":"","fullName":"","title":"","department":""},{"id":"15131549","photo":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-instructor-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/b399205d5011e5bcd8b1ddb839ee7e/P.Sakho.jpg","bio":"Le Dr Pape Sakho est un géographe enseignant-chercheur à la Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines de l’Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar depuis 1996.

CMW’s programming includes a full season of chamber music performances and commissions by its twelve musicians in residence and guest artists; a free, robust music education program for 125 neighborhood young people; workshops, student concerts, and community dinners that involve families and the wider community; and fellowships and training programs that prepare a next generation of musicians to pursue socially-engaged music making.\n\nAs an active performing violinist and violist, Sebastian has performed in recent seasons in Providence, Boston, Los Angeles, Banff, and New York.

The Pennsylvania Quality Milk Program has received both national and international recognition as an excellent extension program, and is widely acknowledged as a successful model for “translational research” (translating laboratory research findings to practical field applications). The Pennsylvania Quality Milk Program (2000-present), has accounted for nearly 65 state wide extension meetings, 6 national and international workshops, 12 peer reviewed publications, 16 proceedings and abstracts, over 195 consultations with dairy producers, veterinarians and other agriculture professionals, 3 competitive research grants, and a web-based software tool that predicts raw milk quality.  \n\nDr. Jayarao's extension education interests have crossed over into classroom didactic teaching venues.
