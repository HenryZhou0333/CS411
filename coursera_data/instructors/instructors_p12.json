His research team utilizes computational and theoretical tools to study how neurons, the elementary microchips of the brain, compute and dynamically adapt to our ever-changing environment. In recent years, his group has worked jointly with several experimental groups worldwide in an endeavor to model a whole piece of the mammalian cortex with the ultimate goal of unraveling how local fine variations within the cortical network underlie specific behavioral function and may give rise to certain brain diseases or to healthy and \u201cindividual\u201d brains. Segev takes a keen interest in the connection between art and the brain, and recently co-edited an \u201cArtists Book\u201d with original etchings by ten top Israeli artists, which were prompted by an encounter with ICNC researchers.",
