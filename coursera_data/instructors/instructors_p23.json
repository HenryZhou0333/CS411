I started my museum career as a volunteer at the Science\nMuseum of Minnesota, soon met people from the Exploratorium and other institutions,\nand quickly realized how deeply a museum philosophy resonated with my own.\nNow, years later, after pursuing graduate studies in education and technology,\nI am even more committed to the idea that constructionism is an incredibly\npowerful way of learning, and that aesthetics matter a great deal. These\ntwo ideas are often overlooked in more formal education settings, outside\nof kindergarten or graduate school. Informal learning spaces for making\nand tinkering offer people a chance to connect to their own learning in\na deeply personal way, which is why I’m thrilled to be able to work with\nsuch a delightfully quirky group of people in the Tinkering Studio.
