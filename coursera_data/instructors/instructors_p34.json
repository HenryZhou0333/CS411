His writing and teaching are thoroughly interdisciplinary, demonstrating how the ideas of the Bible and other ancient writings bear directly on central problems that face our societies in modern times. He brings to his work first-hand acquaintance with archeological finds and primary sources from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. As a testimony to his distinctive interdisciplinary approach to biblical studies, he recently received a full Faculty Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which had not been awarded in biblical studies for many years prior. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jacob Wright writes on an array of topics, ranging from social life in ancient Israel (feasting, war commemoration, urbicide, etc.) to the formation of biblical writings.

He worked on several projects, including the genome-wide characterization of stress responsive and cell cycle regulated genes in human cells, and in defining gene expression signatures of the autoimmune disease Scleroderma. His work on stress responses identified highly distinct gene expression responses to different types of stress in a single cell type, and to the same stress in different cell types. To extend this type of expression analysis to an in vivo setting, he joined the laboratory of Robert Waterston in the University of Washington department of Genome Sciences. There, he developed automated microscopy based methods to allow the single-cell resolution measurement of gene expression in developing embryos of the nematode C. elegans, a major model organism. Applying these methods to define expression patterns at high resolution for a large collection of transcription factors identified novel mechanisms and important regulators of developmental fate specification, which Dr. Murray is now studying in his own laboratory.
