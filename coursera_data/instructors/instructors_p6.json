His interests lie in parasites and behavior; especially \nin situations where the host is social as in the case of ants and \nhumans.<br><br>Role of behavior in disease transmission is of particular\n interest. At one extreme we have parasites that have evolved strategies\n to control host behavior and at the other there is the ability on the \npart of hosts to completely avoid infection through behavioral defense. \nTo approach the former he uses ants and other insects that are \nmanipulated by diverse parasites. Most of David's recent work has been \non fungi that control ant behavior- the zombie ant phenomenon which is one of the most dramatic examples of behavioral manipulation we know about. &nbsp;To approach the latter example (of \nbehavioral defense) David and his group study ant societies in both the rainforest and the lab to ask how to the recognize and avoid disease. &nbsp;David takes his understanding of disease in rain forests and works in tropical farms that have come to replace forests to ask how the ecological disruption affects the spread of plant diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>Humans are also social of course so studying disease in ants leads one to think of disease in humans. &nbsp;David&nbsp;has recently become very interested in human behavior and in particular the expression of altruistic care by certain individuals during epidemics. David is working on the thesis that belief systems shape the expression of this behavior.&nbsp;<br><br>David is very \ninterested in biodiversity and life histories and how extreme our lack \nof knowledge is in this regard. A lot of his work is in tropical rain \nforests on understudied taxa which drives home the apparent ignorance we\n have. &nbsp;Such simple things as the behavior of infected individuals and \nvectors; or the diversity of parasites in apparently well known groups \nremain unknown. &nbsp;This lack of knowledge extends to agroecosystems where he works.
