This group comprises c. 6000 species or nearly two thirds of all birds, and therefore is a suitable model group for global scale studies of diversification processes (biogeography in relation to plate tectonics and climate, patterns and&nbsp;rates of speciation,&nbsp;drivers, notably whether radiations are triggered by by earth history events or by innovations in specific lineages). The analytic work is done in close collaboration with other research groups in Swedish Natural History Museum, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and Department of Integrative Biology at University of California, Berkeley, and Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, as my own contribution mainly is over all visions, coordination and linking together molecular phylogenies and distributional data. The project&nbsp;works closely together with Center of Macroecology (Carsten Rahbek) at the Biological Institute, University of Copenhagen.&nbsp;</p><p>Detailed studies of historical population structure and speciation&nbsp;of African vertebrates is conducted in close collaboration with Hans Siegismund (Biological Institute, University of Copenhagen) and Rauri Bowie (University of California, Berkeley). &nbsp;</p><strong>Primary fields of research</strong><p>Field of expertease broad, comprising evolution, biogeography and taxonomy of birds. Current research has focus on the tropical Andes region of South America and eastern Africa, and global evolution of passerine birds, which comprise more than half of all birds. Mode of speciation and historical and ecological factors affecting the regional patterns of endemism and species richness. This is developed through traditional biogeographical methods supplemented with DNA-based studies of species-rich groups (in collaboration with other institutes) and comprehensive distributional databases (with external collaboration concerning GIS and remotely sensed environmental parameters). Conservation priority analysis (with links to institutions studying human use of natural resources).

S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences.<br><br>In 2002, Prof. Chamovitz was a visiting scientist at the Fred Hutchinson\nCancer Research Center in Seattle. He is currently the Director of the\nManna Center for Plant Biosciences at Tel Aviv University. Chamovitz's\nscientific career has been characterized by novel and field-defining research:\nAs a Ph.D. student in the lab of Joseph Hirschberg he was among the first to\nclone a gene involved in the biosysnthesis of beta-carotene. As a postdoctoral\nfellow in the lab of Xing-Wang Deng at Yale University, he discovered the\nCOP9 Signalosome protein complex that was proposed then to be a master\nregulator of plant development. Later, Prof. Chamovitz's lab was the first\nto show that the COP9 Signalosome is also essential for development of\nanimals. His lab in Tel Aviv has been spearheading the study of this important\nprotein complex and has shown that it is likely involved in a number of\nhuman diseases including cancer. <br><br>Prof. Chamovitz is among the most prominent\nresearchers in this field and is often invited to give lectures at leading\nuniversities worldwide. Currently Chamovitz is developed and was the founding director of the\nnew Program in Food Security and Safety at Tel Aviv University, and does\npro bono consultation for governmental agencies on issues concerning Food\nSecurity. Daniel Chamovitz has published numerous peer reviewed original\nresearch articles and is on the editorial boards of several scientific\njournals. He is also member of the Faculty of 1000, Biology. Chamovitz\nis a sought-after speaker and science commentator. He has been interviewed\nin newspapers and magazines around the world such as The Boston Globe,\nScientific American, Ha'aretz (the daily paper of Israel), and Macleans,\nand also on BBC, NPR, and Australian Public Radio, to name a few, and has\nappeared on television news shows in Israel. He has given popular talks\nat venues such as the California Academy of Sciences, Harvard Arboretum\nand Seattle Town Hall. When not overseeing the research in his lab, Daniel\nChamovitz is passionate about teaching, and especially in developing a\nmodern undergraduate curriculum for plant sciences. He has been awarded\noutstanding lecturer at Tel Aviv University several times. <br><br>He also volunteers\nas a teacher in a local junior high school, engages high school students\nabout science careers, and lectures to groups about the role of Plant Biology\nin feeding a growing world. He has also been known to show up at obscure\nbars and clubs with a guitar in hand. Danny lives in Hod Hasharon with\nhis wife, three kids, dog and cat.",

His interests lie in parasites and behavior; especially \nin situations where the host is social as in the case of ants and \nhumans.<br><br>Role of behavior in disease transmission is of particular\n interest. At one extreme we have parasites that have evolved strategies\n to control host behavior and at the other there is the ability on the \npart of hosts to completely avoid infection through behavioral defense. \nTo approach the former he uses ants and other insects that are \nmanipulated by diverse parasites. Most of David's recent work has been \non fungi that control ant behavior- the zombie ant phenomenon which is one of the most dramatic examples of behavioral manipulation we know about. &nbsp;To approach the latter example (of \nbehavioral defense) David and his group study ant societies in both the rainforest and the lab to ask how to the recognize and avoid disease. &nbsp;David takes his understanding of disease in rain forests and works in tropical farms that have come to replace forests to ask how the ecological disruption affects the spread of plant diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>Humans are also social of course so studying disease in ants leads one to think of disease in humans. &nbsp;David&nbsp;has recently become very interested in human behavior and in particular the expression of altruistic care by certain individuals during epidemics. David is working on the thesis that belief systems shape the expression of this behavior.&nbsp;<br><br>David is very \ninterested in biodiversity and life histories and how extreme our lack \nof knowledge is in this regard. A lot of his work is in tropical rain \nforests on understudied taxa which drives home the apparent ignorance we\n have. &nbsp;Such simple things as the behavior of infected individuals and \nvectors; or the diversity of parasites in apparently well known groups \nremain unknown. &nbsp;This lack of knowledge extends to agroecosystems where he works. To remedy this he came up with the idea of linking farmers around the world to share knowledge and together with Marcel Salathe&nbsp;developed&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.plantvillage.com\" text=\"https://www.plantvillage.com\">PlantVillage</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>He is also very much interested in the concept of the \nextended phenotypes.

He has taught economics and social studies at Wesleyan since 1975, and twice received the University's annual Binswanger Award for Excellence in Teaching, in 1993, the year the award was created, and again in 2012. He has spent sabbatical years as a visiting scholar at Oxford, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and as a Fulbright Visiting Professor at the University of Munich.<br>Professor Adelstein's teaching and scholarly interests lie at the intersection of economics, law, history and philosophy, and more specifically in the historical development of social institutions and the problem of how social order is created and maintained. A pioneer in the application of economic analysis to legal problems, his articles have appeared in scholarly journals in a range of disciplines, and his book on the rise of big business in America and the political reaction to it in the years between the Civil War and World War I, The Rise of Planning in Industrial America, 1865-1914, was published in 2012. He is happily married with two adult daughters and a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs, all of which has given him a deep appreciation of the limits of reason and control.",

This revolutionary program, now implemented in over a dozen countries, focuses on educating birth attendants, women and family caregivers about basic lifesaving techniques they can use without expensive tools or technology.&nbsp;</p><p>This work captured the attention of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and, in 2009, Emory received a 3.5-year grant to develop a community-oriented model for maternal and newborn health in two regions of rural Ethiopia and position it for national scale-up. This work, completed in May 2013, focused on the critical birth-to-48 hour period in and around the time of birth when women and newborns are most likely to die. In 2012, Emory received a 4-year grant from the Canadian International Development Agency-funded Micronutrient Project to replicate the model in a third region of the country, incorporating the pregnancy period and maternal nutrition.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Sibley is Principal Investigator of these initiatives and leads multi-disciplinary teams of Ethiopian colleagues.
