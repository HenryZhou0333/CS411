I\nalso earned an M.Sc. in Management of Technology from MIT Sloan School of Management.</p>\n\n<p>In my career I followed many\npaths. I spent 6 years in the 80s as a software engineer. During my school\nyears I worked as a physics instructor and later as a research associate. In\nthe late 90s I worked for PWC as a consultant, a move that galvanized my future\ndecision to fuse academia, research and teaching with business and industry. </p>\n\n<p><span>Early 2000, I co-founded and\nmanaged ContX, a start-up that developed location-based services for mobile\nproviders focusing on mobile and internet commerce. Too early for the market\nand too late to raise money, we were unable to gain traction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p>In 2003 after Joining IBM I <span>founded and was the global leader of\nIBM's Innovation Management Practice. I led this effort for 5 years during\nwhich I had the pleasure and the privilege of working with outstanding peers\nand exciting clients. I helped clients design and implement, customized\ninnovation processes, explore new technology-based growth opportunities and\nguide open collaboration efforts. I worked with some of the most innovative\ncompanies in the world in many a sector such as communications, industrial and\nfinancial sectors in Asia, US and Europe.&nbsp;\nThis position also allowed me to create and develop strategic innovation\nframeworks.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p>I am a strong\nbeliever in the Israeli Innovation ecosystem and in further developing it. In\n2007 I founded the Israeli Innovation Forum (IIF) at IDC - the\nInterdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. I lead the forum and served as the\nacademic director.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008 after leaving IBM, I\nstarted Demaya. It is a boutique strategic Innovation consulting firm. Together\nwith my partner and with a group of experienced consultants we provide\ninnovation services mainly to large organizations in Israel and outside of\nIsrael.</p>\n\n<span>In 2010, feeling antsy\nagain, I founded and took the position of director and general manager of the&nbsp;MBA program for Management of\nTechnology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the&nbsp;Recanati Business School at Tel Aviv\nUniversity. In addition to our state-of-the-art academic curriculum, we have\nsuccessfully launched unique and innovative activities such as a set of unique\nInnovation and Entrepreneurship Master Classes, and the Delta startup studio -\na pre-accelerator in which our students and graduates can take an idea from\nconcept to execution, experiencing the true meaning of entrepreneurship in\npractice.&nbsp; </span><span>In the 4 years this program\nhas been running it has gained strong recognition in the marketplace, with\nheavy involvement of leading entrepreneurs, innovators and practitioners.&nbsp; With more than 300 students, this program is\nconsidered Recanati's flagship MBA program.&nbsp;</span>",

            "bio": "Lynn Sibley is a Professor in the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University and holds a joint appointment in the Rollins School of Public Health\u2019s Hubert Department of Global Health and an affiliate appointment in the Department of Anthropology. A nurse midwife anthropologist, her career has been devoted to reducing childbirth mortality for women and newborns across the world\u2019s low resource settings by focusing on community-level formative and implementation research and programming. \n\nDr. Sibley led the first field-tests in India and Ethiopia of the Home-Based Lifesaving Skills program that she created in collaboration with colleagues at the American College of Nurse-Midwives. This revolutionary program, now implemented in over a dozen countries, focuses on educating birth attendants, women and family caregivers about basic lifesaving techniques they can use without expensive tools or technology. This work captured the attention of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and, in 2009, Emory received a 3.5-year grant to develop a community-oriented model for maternal and newborn health in two regions of rural Ethiopia and position it for national scale-up. This work, completed in May 2013, focused on the critical birth-to-48 hour period in and around the time of birth when women and newborns are most likely to die. In 2012, Emory received a 4-year grant from the Canadian International Development Agency-funded Micronutrient Project to replicate the model in a third region of the country, incorporating the pregnancy period and maternal nutrition. \n\nDr. Sibley is Principal Investigator of these initiatives and leads multi-disciplinary teams of Ethiopian colleagues. These initiatives operate under the leadership of the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health and Regional Health Bureaus, in collaboration with other partners, including Addis Ababa University, to support the Ministry of Health\u2019s flagship Health Extension Program. Dr. Sibley\u2019s work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded project has contributed to Emory establishing a legal presence in Ethiopia and, as such, has reaffirmed Ethiopia as a priority country by the university. As a result Emory\u2019s Global Health Institute is spearheading an effort to support positions at Emory and in Ethiopia and expand Emory\u2019s presence there. \n\nBeyond the work in Ethiopia, Dr. Sibley was founder and former director of the Center for Research on Maternal and Newborn Survival, an arm of the Lillian Carter Center for Global Health and Social Responsibility at Emory. Her other professional activities over the years include service as an advisor/consultant on community-level maternal and newborn health to well-respected global organizations including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, International Confederation of Midwives, the United States Agency for International Development, and the National Institutes of Health.",

Following postdoctoral fellowships at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the Max Planck Institute in Tuebingen, Germany, he returned to Brown as a faculty member in the Department of Neuroscience in 2000.  His laboratory explores how we identify objects and events in the real world, where both the observer and the environment change over time. The brain must process a dynamic stream of sensory information and efficiently parse this information to reach conclusions about the presence or absence of noteworthy objects to which actions should be directed. By studying the activity of neural circuits involved in this process and by perturbing them artificially, he aims to better understand mechanisms underlying perception. His research is supported by the National Eye Institute, the National Science Foundation, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  He is also the Director of Brown University's Graduate Program in Neuroscience.",
