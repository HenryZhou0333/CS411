            "bio": "<p>Fundamentally, Dr. Martinez is concerned about and fixated on human interrelations \u2014 especially during the Spanish Middle Ages. From the 8th through 15th centuries, Jews, Christians, and Muslims co-existed on the Iberian Peninsula and formed one of the most dynamic civilizations in world history. Their coexistence was tenuous, challenging, and intimate. Blood and family relations were both commingled and jealously kept apart. Conflict, collaboration, and accommodation created new and unexpected political and economic alliances. Shared life on the peninsula generated the conditions for new forms of identity to come to life \u2014 in essence \u2014 hybridized, fractured identities that often borrowed and blended aspects of multiple faiths, values, and families.</p><p>Dr. Martinez\u2019 own extensive research in cathedral, municipal, and national archives has led him to conclude that Jewish, Christian, and Muslim relationships were far more integrated\u2014both positively and negatively\u2014than contemporary scholars and the public realize. To investigate these issues, he blends the traditional approach of the historian (painstaking research and interpretation of medieval manuscripts) with new digital technologies (crowd-sourced analysis by citizen scholars and applied geovisualization). Thus, as a digital humanist his purpose is to share this inter-cultural history with others, via traditional and novel mediums, so that we might learn and appreciate how 21st century human interrelations have been molded by the past.</p><p>Presently, Dr. Mart\u00ednez holds academic positions at the Universidad de Carlos III de Madrid (Spain) and the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs (USA). From Fall 2015 through Summer 2018, Dr. Mart\u00ednez serves as a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/es/FormularioTextoDosColumnas/1371210171135/CONnecting_EXcellence_to_UC3M\" target=\"_blank\">CONEX</a>&nbsp;Experienced Research Fellow and is advancing his MOOC efforts to reach as many as 200,000 students. Since fall 2010, Dr. Mart\u00ednez has served as an Assistant Professor of History at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uccs.edu/~history/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.uccs.edu/~history/\">University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</a>, however, he is currently on research leave. From fall 2008 to spring 2010, he served as the Burton Postdoctoral Fellow at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sju.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Joseph\u2019s University&nbsp;</a>(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and earned his Ph.D. in May 2008 from the Department of History at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Texas at Austin</a>. Dr. Martinez specializes in the study of inter-cultural relations and how group and individual identities hybridize. He is a scholar of medieval and early modern Spain, religious minorities and religious converts in Spain (in particular, Sephardic Jews and conversos), and their Spanish trans-Atlantic migration to Mexico and Bolivia.</p><p>Relying on his specialized training in Spanish paleography and Spanish and Portuguese language expertise, Dr. Martinez has conducted research in approximately 40 local, ecclesiastical, provincial, and national archives in Spain, Mexico, Bolivia, and the United States for his dissertation and current book project. His forthcoming text,&nbsp;<i>Blood, Faith, and&nbsp;Identity:&nbsp;Conversos in Early Modern Spain</i>, is under contract and will be published by the University of Notre Dame Press . He has published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian Crypto-Jews and reviewed books for The Sixteenth Century Journal and The Americas. Dr. Mart\u00ednez is the fortunate recipient of several research fellowships and awards, including ones provided by the Mellon Foundation, the Council for European Studies, Spanish Ministry of Culture\u2019s Program for Cultural Cooperation, the International Institute for Jewish Genealogy (IIJG) and Paul Jacobi Center at the National Library of Israel, and UCLA\u2019s Maurice Amado Program in Sephardic Studies and Center for Jewish Studies.</p><p>Dr. Martinez continues an active research agenda, especially in the area of applying digital tools to the study of medieval and early modern inter-religious Jewish, Catholic, and Muslim coexistence. Currently, Dr. Martinez is the project director for an emerging digital humanities project titled,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://revealingcooperationandconflict.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Revealing Cooperation and Conflict: An Integrated Geovisual and Transcription Project for Plasencia, Spain</a>&nbsp;(circa 1390-1450). The Revealing Cooperation and Conflict project will invigorate the humanities and public\u2019s imagination by creating a visually-compelling, data-robust, and historically-lush digital world known as Virtual Plasencia. Our endeavor will generate a 3D walk-through model of part of the city of Plasencia that reveals Jewish, Catholic, and Muslim interrelations. We aim to recreate the cooperative and challenging processes that emerged during this era of intercultural realization and violence in Spain and Europe. Our team will populate a 3D model by transcribing and indexing census-like events from Book One (1399-1453) of the Capitulary Acts of the Cathedral of Plasencia. The project assembles geovisualization experts, historians, geographers, linguists, and computer scientists in the U.S.A., Switzerland, and Spain as well as citizen scholars from around the world. Our digital world will deliver a portal for the public to immerse themselves in Virtual Plasencia and an open-access data repository for scholars. This start-up project will launch our broader team effort to model issues of identity and social disruption from the 14th-17th centuries. This international collaborative project involves Dr. Victor R. Schinazi of Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich (ETH-Zurich), as well as scholars from Idaho State University, University of Zurich, St. Anselm College, St. Louis University (Madrid Campus), University of Wyoming at Laramie, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and the University of Colorado \u2013 Colorado Springs.</p>",
