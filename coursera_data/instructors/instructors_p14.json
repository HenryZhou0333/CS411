He originated one method of inverse calculation of cardiac epicardial potentials from body surface potentials using statistical constraints. With Robert Plonsey he exploited the introduction of the cardiac bidomain model to show the looping current flow patterns that must exist in cardiac muscle and the unexpected propagation sequences that can result. This work formed the basis for the solution of a number of problems in field stimulation, threshold variability, and defibrillation mechanisms. Together they also wrote the text Bioelectricity, A Quantitative Approach 3E (Springer). More recently he has been involved with models of the movement of DNA under the influence of electric fields, with Professor Fan Yuan of Duke, and measurements and models of the junctional resistances between cardiac cells, with Professor Andrew Pollard of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
