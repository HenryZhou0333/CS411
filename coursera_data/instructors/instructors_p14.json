He originated one method of inverse calculation of cardiac epicardial potentials from body surface potentials using statistical constraints. With Robert Plonsey he exploited the introduction of the cardiac bidomain model to show the looping current flow patterns that must exist in cardiac muscle and the unexpected propagation sequences that can result. This work formed the basis for the solution of a number of problems in field stimulation, threshold variability, and defibrillation mechanisms. Together they also wrote the text Bioelectricity, A Quantitative Approach 3E (Springer). More recently he has been involved with models of the movement of DNA under the influence of electric fields, with Professor Fan Yuan of Duke, and measurements and models of the junctional resistances between cardiac cells, with Professor Andrew Pollard of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In 2008 Professor Barr received the IEEE-Engineering in Medicine and Biology Career Achievement Award, that organization\u2019s highest honor. He gains particular satisfaction from the multitude of ongoing professional accomplishments of several generations of undergraduate and graduate students whose early contacts with bioelectricity were his classes or under his mentorship.</p>\n<p>Roger Barr lived by the train track until age 7 and has been a lifelong train enthusiast.

Allan Vaag wrote his ph.d.-thesis on the glucose-fatty acid cycle in humans including patients with T2D, based on a series of studies documenting for the first time that acute inhibition of lipolysis with a nicotinic acid derivative significantly improves insulin action in patients with T2D (Vaag et al, JCI, 1991).<br>&nbsp;<br>Based on eight original publications, Allan Vaag subsequently wrote his Master of Science Thesis on the current state of art of the pathophysiology of T2D (1999), including studies of prediabetic first degree relatives (Vaag et al, JCI, 1992, etc.) and monozygotic twins discordant for T2D (Vaag et al, JCI, 1995, etc.),<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag has for 10 years been heading a research group at the Steno Diabetes Center in Copenhagen focusing primarily on the impact of the prenatal environment versus genetics on the etiology and pathophysiology of T2D.

For the last decade, one of his main interests has been in the role of the foetal environment in the development of T2D<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag was among the first to describe early defects of both insulin action, including impaired muscle glycogen synthesis, as well as defective insulin secretion in pre-diabetic subjects, contributing substantially to our present knowledge of T2D being not only a multi-factorial disease, but also a multiple organ disease involving muscle, beta cell, liver, adipose tissue, gut, and possibly also various other organ defects.<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag has authored more than 220 original papers and more than 50 review papers in the area of diabetes research in the leading international diabetes and medical journals including New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), JCI, PNAS, Nature Genetics, PloS Medicine, Circulation, BMJ, Lancet, Diabetes, Diabetologia, Journal of Physiology, American Journal of Physiology, JCEM and many others.
