Following an internship in Pediatrics at UCSF in 1983-84, he completed his residency in Neurology at UCSF from 1984-87, serving as Chief Resident in the final year. He then did a two-year fellowship in Stanley Prusiner's Laboratory, investigating the sequence homology of the PrP gene in various rodent species. He went on to become a faculty member in the Department of Neurology at UCSF, established the UCSF Epilepsy Research Laboratory, and was the Robert B. and Ellinor Aird Professor of Neurology from 1998-2000. He then joined Harvard Medical School (HMS) as the Dean for Medical Education for two and a half years, overseeing a re-organization of curricular governance, the creation of a new educational technology program, the establishment of the HMS Academy (a novel structure for the support of the school\u2019s education mission), and the initial planning for a major revision of the curriculum. In 2003, for family reasons, he moved back to UCSF in his current position.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>Dr. Lowenstein is a clinician-scientist who has studied both basic science and clinical aspects of epilepsy. His laboratory studies have addressed the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal network remodeling that occur during epileptogenesis; i.e. the process in which a normal network transforms into a hyperexcitable network capable of producing or relaying seizure activity. The main efforts of his research group focused on the various forms of cellular reorganization that are observed in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy, and the parallels between reorganization in the adult nervous system and normal developmental processes. Important findings by his team included the discovery that seizure activity in an adult model of temporal lobe epilepsy causes a marked increase in the birth of hippocampal neurons, and the recognition that numerous molecules responsible for normal development are also expressed in this same brain region in the adult. These studies bear not only on the neurobiology of epilepsy, but also on the broader issue of neurodevelopment and the capacity for regeneration in the adult nervous system after injury.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>Dr. Lowenstein's main clinical research is focused on approaches designed to advance our understanding of the complex genetics that are thought to underlie a substantial portion of the idiopathic epilepsies, and he is a leader of a national effort (The Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project) designed to make new discoveries in this area (see epgp.org). He has also been actively involved in research on the management and treatment of patients with status epilepticus; i.e. unusually prolonged seizures. He has been the Principal Investigator of a prospective, multi-centered, NIH-sponsored clinical trial looking at the potential benefits of active treatment of patients in status epilepticus in the pre-hospital setting. This five-year study, completed in 1999, helped define the optimal therapy for these patients nationally, and initiated a second large project (for which Dr. Lowenstein is a Co-Principal Investigator) currently underway looking at intramuscular versus intravenous treatment modalities in this setting.&nbsp;</span><br><br>Dr. Lowenstein\u2019s efforts in epilepsy research were recognized by the American Epilepsy Society\u2019s 2001 Basic Research Award, an honor given each year to the foremost basic science investigator whose research \u201ccontributes importantly to understanding and conquering epilepsy.\u201d He also served as president of the American Epilepsy Society in 2003-04.<br><br><span>Dr. Lowenstein has also been actively involved in defining scientific policy at the national level. He served a 4-year term as a member of the Advisory Council of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and has chaired a number of NINDS committees and task forces involved with overall strategic planning for NINDS, as well as the setting of priorities for research in epilepsy.&nbsp;</span><br><br>In addition to his research interests, Dr. Lowenstein is an avid and highly-regarded teacher, and he has had an active role at UCSF concerning issues related to cultural diversity and civil rights. In recognition of his leadership at UCSF in these areas, as well as his long-standing advocacy for students, staff and faculty of all backgrounds, he received the 1998 Black Student Health Association\u2019s Faculty Award, the 1998 UCSF Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Award, the 2006 Holly Smith Award for Exceptional Service to the UCSF School of Medicine, and the 2009 UCSF Chancellor\u2019s Award for Public Service.<br><br>Regarding his teaching accomplishments, Dr. Lowenstein has received every major award related to medical student education granted both locally at UCSF and nationally. He received multiple awards from the 1st and 2nd year classes at UCSF, including those for \"A Major Contribution to Teaching,\" \"Outstanding Lecture,\" \"Outstanding Lecture Series,\" and \"An Outstanding Role Model.\" Other major awards include the 1992 UCSF Academic Senate Distinction in Teaching Award, the 1993 and 1998 UCSF Kaiser Award for Excellence in Teaching, the UCSF Class of 1995 John V. Carbone Award for Excellence in Teaching, and Faculty Teaching Awards in 1994 and 1996. Dr. Lowenstein has given the Keynote Address for graduating students at Commencement Ceremonies at UCSF in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 2000. In 1996, the UCSF students awarded him the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching. He went on to receive the AMSA 1997 National Golden Apple for Teaching Excellence Award, which is given to one medical school teacher in the country each year. In addition, the American Neurological Association (ANA) named him the first recipient of the ANA Distinguished Teacher Award in 1997, and in 1998 he was granted the Alpha Omega Alpha Robert J.

            "bio": "<p>Grant Jensen is a structural biologist at the California Institute of Technology who believes that seeing can be the fastest path to believing. Seeing brings bursts of understanding at a single glance, even though those glances can sometimes be extraordinarily difficult to obtain.</p><p>Jensen works at the front edge of an emerging microscope technology called electron cryotomography (ECT). ECT combines an electron microscope beam, a cryogenic \"plunge freezing\" to fix the sample, and a motor-driven stage to tilt it, one degree at a time, through two axes while a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera reels off still shots of the sample. This river of images and positional data flow to a tomographic computer program, which merges it all and calculates three-dimensional models. With those, Jensen makes moving pictures of things once invisible.</p><p>Take, for example, the stator, or anchored portion, of the bacterial flagellar motor. Flagellar motors are a great natural wonder of biology: self-assembling nanomachines that spin a whip-like flagella, propelling bacteria like speedboats. Over the past 30 years, molecular biologists have labored to deconstruct the flagellar motor into its constituent parts and evolutionary origins. Yet no one had ever seen the stator, the part that holds the motor in place on the cell, in molecular detail. \"A flagellar motor is like an electric drill, except it spins, not a drill bit, but the flagellum,\" Jensen explains. \"But somebody has to hold the drill for it to work. Likewise, something has to hold the flagellar motor for it to spin the flagellum effectively. That's the stator.\" In previous attempts to study the motor, researchers had been unable to see the stator, since it was left behind, stuck to the cell.</p><p>Jensen made it visible. His group used the spirochete bacteria,&nbsp;Treponema primitia, which comes with a pair of flagellar motors. They ran a few dozen&nbsp;T. primitia&nbsp;through the full ECT process before computationally extracting, aligning, and averaging the images into a single, color-enhanced animation. It was the world's first glimpse of an intact flagellar motor in action, held firmly in place by 16 slightly tilted stators. The number of stators was a surprise. So was their structure. A third surprise was a protein collar in this type of cell, sitting atop the spinning rotor and acting as a bearing. Jensen makes the analogy to a car motor and to the difference between studying a box of engine parts and studying an assembled engine. \"You can study each part in isolation, but eventually you're going to have to pop the hood and see how the whole thing works together.\"</p><p>Jensen collaborates with a handpicked circle of HIV and bacterial structural investigators. One of his HIV studies revealed that a key structural protein, Gag, thought to fully line HIV's inner membrane surface, instead forms large patches, \"like the continents drifting on the Earth's surface,\" says Jensen. Another HIV study looked at the formation of the capsid protein shell that forms the core of mature HIV viral particles, called virions.</p><p>In other collaborations, Jensen's ECT lab has shed new light on one of the hottest issues in microbiology: Do bacteria have a cytoskeleton? The answer in any textbook more than a few years old is no. Bacteria are prokaryotes, say the textbooks, and prokaryotes don't have the cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors of eukaryotes (organisms, like mammals, that have cells with a nucleus). The textbooks are being rewritten\u2014thanks, in part, to Jensen's convincing images to the contrary.</p><p>Strong evidence for the existence of a dynamic bacterial cytoskeleton is pouring in from a variety of molecular and genetic experiments. Direct imaging, though, has been difficult. It's a matter of size and resolution, says Jensen. Microscopes that use light do an excellent job of tracking fluorescently tagged filaments moving about inside eukaryotes such as yeast. Yeast cells are about 6 microns across.&nbsp;Caulobacter crescentus, a favorite bacterial model, is about 0.4 microns in diameter. Fluorescent tagging and light microscopy have serious limitations in such close quarters, says Jensen. On the other extreme, atomic-scale x-ray crystallography can't be applied to cells. The resolution possible with ECT is nicely midrange, enabling it to catch the bacterial cytoskeleton in action. Furthermore, ECT captures shape as well as position. Collaborating with international microbiologists and computational biologists, Jensen's lab showed that&nbsp;C. crescentus&nbsp;cells are full of cytoskeletal filaments. Their 2006 paper in&nbsp;Molecular Biology&nbsp;(and video on Jensen's Web site) stirred up the entire field. According to Jensen, seeing the filaments for the first time produced some surprises: some were in expected locations; some were not or didn't appear as predicted.</p><p>Jensen is cautious about the scientific limits of ECT. Just because ECT, at its current level of development, hasn't yet revealed a structure or a mechanism in action doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, he says. ECT is a technology in progress\u2014and an expensive one. That's why Jensen considers his becoming an HHMI investigator both an honor and a boon. HHMI's resources will help him push the boundaries of what is possible. Beyond the costly and ever-changing hardware, software, and service requirements, an ECT lab requires a strong cadre of biologist-physicist-computer scientists to run current experiments and to dream up the means for new ones. Becoming an HHMI investigator will help Jensen sustain and expand his expert team.</p><p>Jensen also has a passion for presenting biology in a visible and accessible format. He and his group have made animations that depict HIV maturation and bacterial motility, using the same technology used to make box office blockbusters like&nbsp;Shrek. Jensen firmly believes that giving the general public visual depictions of cellular biology will have profound consequences. \"We (humans) are well equipped with our eyes and brain to understand complex objects moving in space,\" says Jensen. \"Humans are wonderfully adept at making quick sense of what they see. Soon we will distill the essence of thousand-page biology textbooks into animations that even grade-schoolers will comprehend. Once everybody has a good sense of what is going on inside the cell, important national dialogues about biomedical issues will be different.\"</p>",
