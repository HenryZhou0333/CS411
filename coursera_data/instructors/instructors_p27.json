His work has appeared in the Harvard Law Review, the Columbia Law Review, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law, the Northwestern Law Review, and as the centerpiece of a symposium in Perspectives on Politics, a leading peer-reviewed political science journal. In addition to his interests in constitutional law and legislation, Ruger also teaches and writes in the area of health law and pharmaceutical regulation. His current research in that field draws on his broader work on judicial power and constitutionalism, and addresses the manner in which American legal institutions \u2013 including the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 have shaped the field of health law over the past two centuries.",

She was formerly Banting Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability.  Her research focuses on urban climate change governance, with an emphasis on practical, integrated approaches to sustainability. Sarah currently explores the dynamics of potentially transformative community-level innovation in response to climate change, and the drivers of emerging partnerships between the private and public sectors.  This action-oriented and interdisciplinary research supports communities as they transition towards sustainability and fills a critical gap in our understanding of transformative development path shifts.
