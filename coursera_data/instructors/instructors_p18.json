I was particularly interested in trying to find sensible ways to help\npeople make changes to their lifestyle to reduce their likelihood of diseases\nsuch as heart disease. I was researching this from the level of a population\n(any defined group of people) rather than supporting a particular individual.\nYou will learn more about these differences as you work through this six week\nMOOC. </p>\n\n<span>About 8 years ago I moved from the National\nHealth Service to take up a more dedicated teaching post at the University of\nManchester. A lot of my work involves managing and teaching on the online\ndistance learning programme in public health (<a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/phpc\" title=\"Link: http://www.manchester.ac.uk/phpc\">http://www.manchester.ac.uk/phpc</a>).\nI really enjoy supporting this world leading course because like this MOOC,\nstudents are registered on it from all over the world. How amazing is that! I\nam also passionate about teaching and learning in all aspects of population\nhealth, including members of the public, students and professionals. This is\nbecause all education contributes in different ways to improve the health and\nliving conditions of everyone in the world .

I am Chair of the UK\nChildren\u2019s working group on radio aids and the UK lead for Healthy Hearing for\nthe Special Olympics. I have extensive international work for example in\nVietnam, Meghalaya In India and Ghana. Prior to working at the University of\nManchester I worked across the age range and types of educational provision,\nincluding both oral and sign bilingual settings. I also taught adult\nspeechreading classes. I believe deaf children and adults can do anything,\ngiven the chance. My hope is that by joining this MOOC you will be an agent of\nchange and help to ensure this group of individuals life chances are improved,\npotential given opportunity and that exclusion of deaf individuals is\nchallenged by positive alternatives. I look forward to welcoming you on the\nMOOC and to working together.</span></p>",

The Impact of Populism on Parties, Media and the Public in Western Europe\u2019 (cum laude). \n\nMy research focuses on topics such as populism, left-right radicalism, voting behavior, public opinion and democracy. I study the reasons why people vote for populist parties; I assess the consequences of the rise of such parties for other actors in the electoral process; and I look at how social and economic inequalities shape political attitudes and electoral behavior. \n\nI teach courses in the Bachelor and Master programs of the Department of Political Science about comparative politics, populism, and research methodology. I also write about these and related topics on blogs and in newspapers and magazines. I am co-founder of the Dutch political science blog Stuk Rood Vlees.",
