Her\n    duties include curriculum development and administering the prototype portfolio\n    assessments for the course. The course, once out of its pilot\n    phase, aims to broaden participation in computer science as a part of the\n    National Science Foundation\u2019s CS10K initiative.</p>\n<p>In 2003, Rebecca developed and taught the very first online course in\n    a Virginia public school system.

In addition,\n    she is currently developing online training for Virginia AP computer science\n    in the NMSI grant program. These training modules aim to better prepare\n    teachers new to the field so they can both implement and teach a computer\n    science program at the AP level regardless of their own teaching background.\n    &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a recognized leader in her field, Rebecca has been called on to provide training for secondary school computer science educators at institutions\n    nationwide, including Purdue University, the University of Virginia, and Georgia\n    Tech.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>A graduate of the College of William &amp; Mary with a BS in mathematics,\n    Rebecca has a year remaining before earning her Master of Science degree\n    from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in information technology, with a concentration\n    in computer science. She also has completed extensive post-graduate coursework\n    at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. She holds licenses from\n    the state of Virginia to teach both mathematics and computer science.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;*Advanced Placement (AP) is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.&nbsp;<br></p>",

            "bio": "Alex Dehgan is the co-founder of a new startup, Conservation X Labs, focused on harnessing exponential technologies, open innovation, and entrepreneurship to conservation, including launching the first Grand Challenge for Conservation.  He was the inaugural David Rubenstein Fellow in the Office of the Provost at Duke University where he helped set up an initiative on Conservation Innovation and lectured on innovation for conservation and development, which is being developed into a Massive Open Online Course with Coursera.  Alex is currently writing a book, The Snow Leopard Startup, through Public Affairs, an imprint of Perseus Books Group, on setting up the first national park in Afghanistan.\n\nDr. Alex Dehgan recently served as the Chief Scientist at the U.S. Agency for International Development, with rank of Assistant Administrator, and founded and headed the Office of Science and Technology, and created the vision for the Global Development Lab.  As the Agency\u2019s first chief scientist in two decades, Dr. Dehgan implemented the President\u2019s promise to restore science and technology to its rightful place within USAID. During his tenure at USAID, Alex was the architect of a number of new Agency institutions, including the Grand Challenges for Development program, its partnerships with universities (HESN) and federal science agencies (PEER), the independent office of science and technology, the position of the Agency geographer and the GeoCenter, and the data teams.  In less than four years, Alex built the Office of Science and Technology from scratch to an 80-person office, a $100 M dollar research program, and leveraged or raised $500 million dollars from other donors and partners.  Alex was also part of the founding team for the creation of the Policy, Planning, and Learning Bureau, and initiated the reinvigoration of the AAAS program, and the AAAS overseas programs, which put scientists and engineers directly into USAID missions and technical bureaus.  Under Alex, the Office of Science & Technology also implemented the Agency\u2019s first scientific integrity and research policies.\n\nPrior to coming to USAID, Dr. Dehgan worked in multiple positions within the Office of the Secretary at the Department of State and within the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, where he developed a science diplomacy strategy towards addressing our most challenging foreign policy issues in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and the greater Islamic world.  This included initiating the Obama Administration\u2019s engagement efforts with Iran through science diplomacy, working under Amb. Dennis Ross, and serving as a liaison to the late Amb. Richard Holbrooke.  Dr. Alex Dehgan was also the founding Afghanistan Country Director for the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Afghanistan Biodiversity Conservation Program.
