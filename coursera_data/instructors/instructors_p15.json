Those were years during which the corporate world finally realized the necessity to shift from transaction based to relationship based marketing. \nWhat really interests Prof. Boehm from a marketing standpoint is the management of customer relationships in order to increase a firm\u2019s long-term profitability. \u201cCustomers are important intangible assets of a firm that should be valued and managed\u201d, he says. \u201cOnly by attracting, retaining, and growing profitable customer relationships will firms be successful in the future\u201d. His research therefore aims to provide managerial implications on how to build profitable and long-lasting customer relationships. His primary concern is to quantify the impact of various customer management activities on a customer\u2019s lifetime value \u2013 the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over a customer\u2019s lifetime. \nAt the same time, Prof. Boehm develops analytical models to estimate or approximate a customer\u2019s lifetime value. \u201cOne of the major challenges in customer relationship management is still to arrive at reliable estimates of a customer\u2019s future profits and lifetime\u201d, he says. \u201cNot being able to measure a customer\u2019s lifetime value prevents the development of successful strategies for customer management\u201d. \nProf. Boehm believes that his work on customer relationship management has broad implications for the corporate world. \u201cI intend to develop insights on how to satisfy customer needs, but at the same time to consider the monetary consequences of doing so,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will provide firms with a roadmap for growth.\u201d \n\nBackground: \n\u2022\tPhD in Marketing, Frankfurt University, Germany\n\u2022\tSSP, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US\n\u2022\tMBA, Australian Graduate School of Entrepreneurship, Australia \n\u2022\tBA in International Business, Reutlingen University, Germany \n\u2022\tDean of Programs, IE Business School\n\u2022\tAssociate Dean of Master in Management Programs, IE Business School\n\u2022\tDean of Undergraduate Studies, IE University, 2008 to 2010\n\u2022\tProfessor of Marketing, IE Business School, 2006 to present\n\u2022\tVisiting Scholar, AGSM, University of New South Wales, Australia, 2006\n",
