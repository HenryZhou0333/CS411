Since then, he has been engaged in various aspects of diabetes research with an emphasis on the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Allan Vaag holds clinical specialist recognition in Endocrinology and in General Internal Medicine. Allan Vaag wrote his ph.d.-thesis on the glucose-fatty acid cycle in humans including patients with T2D, based on a series of studies documenting for the first time that acute inhibition of lipolysis with a nicotinic acid derivative significantly improves insulin action in patients with T2D (Vaag et al, JCI, 1991).<br>&nbsp;<br>Based on eight original publications, Allan Vaag subsequently wrote his Master of Science Thesis on the current state of art of the pathophysiology of T2D (1999), including studies of prediabetic first degree relatives (Vaag et al, JCI, 1992, etc.) and monozygotic twins discordant for T2D (Vaag et al, JCI, 1995, etc.),<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag has for 10 years been heading a research group at the Steno Diabetes Center in Copenhagen focusing primarily on the impact of the prenatal environment versus genetics on the etiology and pathophysiology of T2D. In 2011, Allan Vaag was appointed full Professor of Endocrinology (Chair) at the Copenhagen University, situated at the Danish National State Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen.<br>&nbsp;<br>The work of Allan Vaag is based upon detailed, extensive and well-powered integrative physiological studies of predominantly people at risk of T2D, which over the last two decades have documented a range of early genetic, epigenetic as well as non-genetic molecular defects of muscle and adipose tissue biology in T2D. For the last decade, one of his main interests has been in the role of the foetal environment in the development of T2D<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag was among the first to describe early defects of both insulin action, including impaired muscle glycogen synthesis, as well as defective insulin secretion in pre-diabetic subjects, contributing substantially to our present knowledge of T2D being not only a multi-factorial disease, but also a multiple organ disease involving muscle, beta cell, liver, adipose tissue, gut, and possibly also various other organ defects.<br>&nbsp;<br>Allan Vaag has authored more than 220 original papers and more than 50 review papers in the area of diabetes research in the leading international diabetes and medical journals including New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), JCI, PNAS, Nature Genetics, PloS Medicine, Circulation, BMJ, Lancet, Diabetes, Diabetologia, Journal of Physiology, American Journal of Physiology, JCEM and many others.

Those were years during which the corporate world finally realized the necessity to shift from transaction based to relationship based marketing.\n\nWhat really interests Prof. Boehm from a marketing standpoint is the management of customer relationships in order to increase a firm’s long-term profitability. “Customers are important intangible assets of a firm that should be valued and managed”, he says. “Only by attracting, retaining, and growing profitable customer relationships will firms be successful in the future”. His research therefore aims to provide managerial implications on how to build profitable and long-lasting customer relationships. His primary concern is to quantify the impact of various customer management activities on a customer’s lifetime value – the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over a customer’s lifetime. \nAt the same time, Prof. Boehm develops analytical models to estimate or approximate a customer’s lifetime value. “One of the major challenges in customer relationship management is still to arrive at reliable estimates of a customer’s future profits and lifetime”, he says. “Not being able to measure a customer’s lifetime value prevents the development of successful strategies for customer management”.\n\nProf. Boehm believes that his work on customer relationship management has broad implications for the corporate world. “I intend to develop insights on how to satisfy customer needs, but at the same time to consider the monetary consequences of doing so,” he says. “This will provide firms with a roadmap for growth.”","fullName":"Martin Boehm","title":"Professor of Marketing","department":"Dean of Programs"},{"id":"5685960","photo":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-instructor-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/94/5a6520e51a11e487ded9e3087aae37/NoahBubenhofer-v2600600.png","bio":"<p>Als germanistischer Linguist interessiere ich mich für die Sprache als Indikator für gesellschaftliche und kulturelle Phänomene.</p><p>Nach dem Studium der Germanistik, Kommunikations- und Medienwissenschaften und der Soziologie an den Universitäten&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.unibas.ch/\" title=\"Link: http://www.unibas.ch/\">Basel</a>&nbsp;und&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uni-freiburg.de/\" title=\"Link: http://www.uni-freiburg.de/\">Freiburg im Breisgau</a>&nbsp;leite ich seit März 2015 mein Projekt \"<a href=\"http://www.visual-linguistics.net/\" title=\"Link: http://www.visual-linguistics.net/\">Visual Linguistics</a>\" am&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cl.uzh.ch/people/team/bubenhofer.html\">Institut für Computerlinguistik</a>&nbsp;an der&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uzh.ch/\">Universität Zürich</a>.
