ESOPI-21 (2009–2012) was a partnership with UNC’s School of Government to provide students with a Master’s of Science in Library/Information Science and a Master’s of Public Administration so that they can work in the public policy arena concerning digital preservation and curation issues and laws. CDCG (2009–2013) was a collaboration with IMLS and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Digital Curation Center (DCC), both of the United Kingdom, to explore educational and guidance needs of cultural heritage information professionals in the digital curation domain in the US and the UK. In 2011, IMLS awarded Dr. Tibbo funding for the Educating Stewards of the Public Information Infrastructure (ESOPI2) project that is continuing the work of ESOPI-21 through 2015. In April 2013, Dr. Tibbo received an IMLS award for the “Curating Research Assets and Data using Lifecycle Education: Data Management Education Tools for Librarians, Archivists, & Content Creators or CRADLE project that will extend through 2016 and funded the creation of the data management MOOC. </p>\n\n\n<p>Dr. Tibbo is the head of the Standards and Policies Community of Practice for the DataNet Federation Consortium and was also a co-PI with collaborators from the University of Michigan and the University of Toronto on a National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)-funded project to develop standardized metrics for assessing use and user services for primary sources in government settings.
