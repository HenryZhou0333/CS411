Thus, the \nhost immune system is a critical regulator of the cycle of infection and\n transmission that determines large-scale patterns of parasite \ndistribution and burden at the population scale.<br><br>Matthew works with Dr. Isabella Cattadori\n to study the impact of interactions between worm life-history \ncharacteristics and host immune response on population-level \ntransmission processes. &nbsp;They combine lab-scale experiments in a \nrabbit/worm model with long-term temporal observations of worm burden \nand distribution in wild populations of rabbit to quantify the role of \nwithin host processes in determining population scale processes.<br><br><b>Dynamics of directly transmitted pathogens on host networks</b><br>Matthew\n uses simulation and analytical techniques to investigate how the spread\n of disease in social networks of hosts is affected by heterogeneities\n in contacts and local restrictions on transmission. These have \nimportant implications for the scaling of transmission across networks \nof different size and geometries — and can even lead to structural \nevolution of the network itself (as hosts are removed by mortality or \nacquired immunity).<br><br><b>Statistical methods for estimating transmission rates</b><br>Disease\n incidence data are often gathered at spatial and temporal scales that \nare coarse relative to scales considered by quantitative epidemiological\n models of host-pathogen systems (e.g. case counts are generally \nreported over discrete time intervals, while many classic epidemic \nmodels employ differential calculus, which makes predictions in \ncontinuous time). Furthermore, observed data often suffer from \nincomplete reporting, imperfect diagnosis, measurement error and other \nbiases. One of the great challenges in quantitative epidemiology is to \ndevelop statistical models that provide a coherent link between theory \nand data.
