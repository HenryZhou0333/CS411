She is also the director/goddess of two science organizations related to AIDS, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/vdc/\">Vaccine Dinner Club</a> (official motto: \u201cHot Food, Cool Science \u2026 Count Me In!\u201d) and the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/network/index.php\">CFAR Network Pizza Party</a> (official motto: \u201cBetter Science Through Pizza\u201d). Over the course of almost three decades she has worked variously as a community educator, patient educator, medical educator, science educator, and research mentor in the field of HIV/AIDS.<br></p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen\u2019s entry into AIDS came in 1985, only four years into the epidemic, when she began volunteering as a community educator at <a href=\"http://www.aidatlanta.org/page.aspx?pid=295\">AID Atlanta</a>, one of the nation's first AIDS service organizations. In 1988 she joined the Emory School of Medicine as a medical educator for Emory\u2019s first AIDS-specific grant, the <a href=\"http://www.seatec.emory.edu/index.html\">Southeast AIDS Training and Education Center</a> (SEATEC). Because, in the early days of the epidemic, almost all practicing doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care providers had finished their training before the advent of AIDS, SEATEC was charged with teaching&nbsp;health profession students and practitioners in a four state area how to provide care for patients with HIV while protecting themselves physically and emotionally.</p>\n\n<p>In 1988 Dr. Hagen also began working as a patient educator in the newly formed <a href=\"http://www.gradyhealth.org/clinic/63/\">Grady Memorial Hospital Infectious Disease Program</a> (IDP). Although the majority of the 5,000 patients that the IDP now sees annually are fully versed in the latest research about HIV treatment, in the IDP\u2019s earliest days most of the patients that Dr. Hagen worked with had never even heard of the disease that was making them sick.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Emory University received its first funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) to expand the depth and breadth of HIV/AIDS research taking place at the University and Dr. Hagen was recruited as Assistant Director of the new Center. At CFAR she fosters multidisciplinary linkages; produces a weekly electronic newsletter, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/lincs/communication/news.html\"><i>Network News</i></a>; helps bring new faculty into AIDS research; and assists junior faculty in developing their HIV/AIDS research careers. She also works on contract with the CDC to provide workforce development training for HIV/AIDS medical staff in Africa, supervises graduate student research on HIV/AIDS, and is a member of the City of Atlanta Jurisdictional HIV Prevention Planning Group and the Ryan White Outside Review Committee for the State of Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen is the recipient of two of the highest honors that Emory University can bestow: the Emory Award of Distinction and Teacher of the Year.  She has made it her life\u2019s work to help people understand the complexity of HIV/AIDS.</p>",

I received my Bachelor's degree from the ILR School at Cornell University. I am also on the Graduate Faculty of Minnesota's Department of Applied Economics and the Minnesota Population Center (MPC), and am a member of the Social Media and Business Analytics Collaborative (SOBACO).\n\nMy research is in personnel economics, a branch of labor economics that concerns employment issues within firms. I work with companies to analyze their compensation plans, incentives, and staffing practices for the primary purpose of improving organizational performance. I've done research with salespeople, police, firefighters, nurses, and manufacturing workers, and my research has been covered by national news outlets like the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, NBC News, PBS Newshour, LA Times, Deseret, the Baltimore Sun, and others. Here are some recent projects:\n\nUsing \"Big Data\" to Improve Organizational Performance. I'm working with a company that provides sales performance management software over the cloud to bring microeconomic methods to data science. A sample research question: \"Do the best salespeople tend to make the best sales managers? If not, who does?\"\n\nWorking with Companies. I also work with individual companies to analyze the effectiveness of their incentives, staffing, and retention programs. A sample research question: \"How effective are manufacturing plants' incentives to reduce defect rates?\"\n\nMy teaching outside of Coursera includes or has included compensation and benefits, statistics, management, business economics, and negotiations for undergraduates, MBAs, HR Masters, executives, and doctoral students.",

His account of innovations created in New York, <i>Urban\nDesign as Public Policy</i>, was a strong influence in establishing urban design as a necessary element of local government and in making city design a well-recognized profession.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Jonathan Barnett has written many books, book chapters, and articles about city design. In his most recent book, <i>City Design: Modernist, Traditional, Green, and Systems Perspectives, </i>Barnett explores the history and current practice of the\n    four most important ways of designing cities, and suggests a fifth way which draws on all four approaches.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Jonathan Barnett has also developed his own extensive consulting practice as a city-designer, with long-term consulting relationships with the cities of Charleston, S.C., Cleveland, Kansas City, Nashville, Norfolk, Miami, Omaha, and Pittsburgh,\n    and with the cities of Xiamen and Tianjin in China. He has also been the urban design advisor for two planned communities in Cambodia, and for several large-scale projects in Korea,</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Currently he is interested in projects that involve controlling growth at the suburban fringe and in redeveloping by-passed areas in the older parts of metropolitan regions, and has worked on growth management plans for suburban communities in Missouri,\n    Wisconsin, and New York State, and on the redesign of several former railway yards and military bases.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;With his students at the University of Pennsylvania, Jonathan Barnett has prepared growth management studies for central Florida, done research into the potential effects of sea-level rise in the Delaware River Basin and the New Jersey Shore, and\n    has demonstrated methods of incorporating Geographic Information Systems into development regulations in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Jonathan Barnett is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Yale College, and has a Master\u2019s degree in Architecture from the University of Cambridge, and a Master of Architecture from the Yale School of Architecture.&nbsp; He is a fellow of both the American\n    Institute of Architects and the American Institute of Certified Planners.\n</p>",

His most recent work examines the institution of coauthorship using the idea of shared intentionality, and argues that copyright law, despite its overall commitment to market-based utilitarianism, recognizes there to be situations where the very process of collaboration can provide creators with an inducement to create. He is also working on a book that explores the origins, development, and uniqueness of Indian private law. While at Yale Law School, he was an Articles &amp; Essays Editor of the Yale Law Journal and a Student Fellow at the Information Society Project (ISP).

The use of these \nmathematical and statistical tools assists in his understanding of \npatterns of disease incidence, and the effects of heterogeneity, in time\n and space.<br><span><br>Matthew's specific areas of research include:<br><br></span><b><a href=\"http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/lectures-and-events/frontiers/watch-videos/epidemic/eve-of-eradication\">Measles dynamics in developing countries</a></b><a href=\"http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/lectures-and-events/frontiers/watch-videos/epidemic/eve-of-eradication\">&nbsp;</a><br>Measles\n still kills hundreds of thousands of children each year in developing \ncountries. Attempts to eradicate the disease through mass vaccination \nare hampered by both logistical and epidemiological challenges; for \ninstance, high birth rates can make it difficult to maintain the \nnecessary 95% vaccine coverage.<br><br>In collaboration with&nbsp;<i><a href=\"http://www.msf.org/\">Medecins Sans&nbsp;</a></i><b><i><a href=\"http://www.msf.org/\">Fronti\u00e8res</a></i></b>&nbsp;Matthew and his team are investigating local and \nregional dynamics of annual measles epidemics in West African countries \n(Niger, Tchad,\n Democratic Republic of Congo), in order to recommend vaccination \nstrategies to minimize mortality and morbidity due to measles. They are \nusing time series analysis and epidemic models to investigate:<br><ul><li>The nature of the strong annual seasonality in incidence at the regional scale</li><li>Local variation in the scale of measles outbreaks</li></ul><br><b>Vector behavior and spatial transmission</b><br>Scaling within-host immune dynamics to populations<br>Dynamics of directly transmitted pathogens on host networks<br>Statistical methods for estimating transmission rates<br><ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 22px;\">Discrete time, stochastic models to develop statistical methods to estimate transmission rates for incidence data</span></li><li><span style=\"line-height: 22px;\">Computational methods (e.g. Markov chain Monte Carlo) to account for the uncertainty due to imperfect measurement</span></li></ul><br><b>Scaling within-host immune dynamics to populations</b><br>The rapid \nclearance or long-term persistence of parasites within hosts is \ndetermined by the interaction of both parasite life-history \ncharacteristics and the immune response of the host to infection. \nVariation along this axis has implications for the rate of parasite \nshedding, the accumulation of transmissible stages in the environment, \nand the encounter rate and transmission rate in naive hosts. Thus, the \nhost immune system is a critical regulator of the cycle of infection and\n transmission that determines large-scale patterns of parasite \ndistribution and burden at the population scale.<br><br>Matthew works with Dr. Isabella Cattadori\n to study the impact of interactions between worm life-history \ncharacteristics and host immune response on population-level \ntransmission processes. &nbsp;They combine lab-scale experiments in a \nrabbit/worm model with long-term temporal observations of worm burden \nand distribution in wild populations of rabbit to quantify the role of \nwithin host processes in determining population scale processes.<br><br><b>Dynamics of directly transmitted pathogens on host networks</b><br>Matthew\n uses simulation and analytical techniques to investigate how the spread\n of disease in social networks of hosts is affected by heterogeneities\n in contacts and local restrictions on transmission. These have \nimportant implications for the scaling of transmission across networks \nof different size and geometries \u2014 and can even lead to structural \nevolution of the network itself (as hosts are removed by mortality or \nacquired immunity).<br><br><b>Statistical methods for estimating transmission rates</b><br>Disease\n incidence data are often gathered at spatial and temporal scales that \nare coarse relative to scales considered by quantitative epidemiological\n models of host-pathogen systems (e.g. case counts are generally \nreported over discrete time intervals, while many classic epidemic \nmodels employ differential calculus, which makes predictions in \ncontinuous time). Furthermore, observed data often suffer from \nincomplete reporting, imperfect diagnosis, measurement error and other \nbiases. One of the great challenges in quantitative epidemiology is to \ndevelop statistical models that provide a coherent link between theory \nand data. He is developing:<br><ul><li>Discrete time, stochastic models to develop statistical methods to estimate transmission rates for incidence data</li><li>Computational methods (e.g. Markov chain Monte Carlo) to account for the uncertainty due to imperfect measurement</li></ul>",
