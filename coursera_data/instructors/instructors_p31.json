Свернул с финансовой дорожки и создал кружок робототехники для подростков. Готовил их к соревнованиям. Стал посещать конференции, а затем проводил мастер-классы для тех, кто тоже хочет организовать занятия.\nСовместно с коллегами в 2013 году разработал новые соревнования – Робопрофи – для конкурса Робот для жизни и провел их. В 2014 году впервые провел Arduino-номинацию на фестивале Робофест, а для российского финала Russian Robot Olympiad 2014 сделал творческую категорию. С тех пор эти соревнования стали регулярными.\n\nЛетом 2014 провел двухнедельную мастерскую в детском лагере Никола-Ленивца, а затем преподавал в выездной школе, посвященной программированию и робототехнике, которую провели ABBYY и Яндекс. В 2015 году стал руководителем направления робототехники в GoTo Camp, выездных школах, где участники создали десятки проектов, от прототипов умных домов и операторских тележек до робота-бубниста и принтера для незрячих.\n\nВ 2014 году с коллегами начал проект Роболабы: мероприятия для школьников и студентов, где участники параллельно решают усложненные задачи, а затем проводят рефлексию сделанной работы и оценивают чужие в ходе серии мероприятий.","fullName":"Алексей Перепелкин","title":"Руководитель направления робототехники","department":"Лаборатория инновационных образовательных технологий МФТИ"},{"id":"5229812","bio":"","fullName":"","title":"","department":""},{"id":"14138400","photo":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-instructor-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/77/d87100d02c11e5b8deefdb1df697fa/rodolfo.jpg","bio":"Licenciado en Educación, Profesor de Historia y Ciencias Sociales de la Universidad Alberto Hurtado, con experiencia en integración de Tics en Educación Superior y asesoramiento docente.
