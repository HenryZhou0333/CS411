First, I use the epidemiologic framework to explain the risk factors, natural history, and consequences of major mental disorders. Second, I take the sociologic approach to understand the occurrence of the subset of bizarre behaviors that generally are labeled as psychiatric disorders. In the area of psychiatric epidemiology, I have conducted research on the incidence and natural history of schizophrenia using data from psychiatric case registers in several locations around the world. At the current time&nbsp;research focuses on the relationship of autoimmune diseases to&nbsp;risk for autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. I have investigated common mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder and the anxiety disorders, in the context of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Followup, a twenty year cohort study. A somewhat surprising finding from that study was the degree to which major depressive disorder was predictive of the new occurrence of important physical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer. The current phase of the ECA project is a collaboration with four ECA sites linking data on mental disorders to the National Death Index, in the largest population-based study of this topic in the United States to date.","fullName":"","title":"Professor, Mental Health","department":"Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"id":"16246494","photo":"https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-instructor-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b1/8500408f9911e584e74d372c6aa00f/FotoSemblanza-SB.jpg","bio":"Samira Barbosa es Lic. en Ciencias de la Comunicación, con Especialidad en Mercadotecnia por el Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey y certificación en Reingeniería de Procesos por la Universidad Iberoamericana. \n\nDirector Comercial Asociado de la empresa Team 2B SA de CV.
