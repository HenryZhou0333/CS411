In astrophysics, his main research tools have been the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the simulations which support them both. The McKay lab uses these tools to probe the growth and nature of cosmic structure as well as the expansion history of the Universe, especially through studies of galaxy clusters. He has also studied astrophysical transients as part of the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment.</p><p>In education research, Professor McKay works to understand and improve postsecondary student outcomes using the rich, extensive, and complex digital data produced in the course of educating students in the 21st century. In 2011, he launched the E2Coach computer tailored support system, using data to provide personalized coaching to thousands of students. In January 2014, he began leading the <a href=\"https://rebuild.lsa.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">REBUILD project</a>, a college-wide effort to increase the use of evidence-based methods in introductory STEM courses.

In this role he launched the Honors Core Curriculum: a set of twelve large courses specially designed to provide a collective experience to first year Honors students. He also created the Honors Summer Fellows program, which provides research support to an interdisciplinary group of 25-30 senior thesis writers drawn from across all three divisions of our college each summer. He has led this program since its inception, working with donors to develop an endowment to ensure its permanent support.</p>",

He is currently researching voluntary disclosures, the internal and external organization of firms, how macro-micro interactions affect investment policy, and the intensity and maturity of corporate hedging activity. A common theme in his work is the role of industry structure in explaining firm-level behavior. His work in emerging markets includes a study of stock-market return contagion between Europe and Asia, differences in governance of affiliated investment funds in China, and currently, a comparison of corporate risk management practices across the BRICS countries and the West (an IEMS-sponsored project). He is leading an industry-sponsored study on the economic impact of improving the fund-management environment in Hong Kong. Much of his work has been published in leading journals such as The Journal of Finance, The Review of Financial Studies, and The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis. Professor MacKay is associate editor for the Multinational Finance Journal and the International Review of Financial Analysis. He previously held appointments at Southern Methodist University (Dallas, Texas) and Laval University (Quebec, Canada). ",
