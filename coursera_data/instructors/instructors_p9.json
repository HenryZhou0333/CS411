ShK-186, a peptide \ninhibitor of Kv1.3, is scheduled to begin human trials in 2011. \nSelective KCa3.1 blockers have been shown to prevent vascular stenosis \nfollowing angioplasty in rats and atherosclerosis in mice. We also \ndeveloped a transgenic model for cerebellar ataxia based on targeting \nthe KCa2.x potassium channel in deep cerebellar neurons. The results \nfrom this study suggested the possibility of using KCa2.x \nchannel-openers as therapy for cerebellar ataxia. Based on this work a \nclinical trial of riluzole in cerebellar ataxia was performed in Italy \nand the drug was found to be effective in reducing the symptoms of the \ndisease.\n\t<br>",
